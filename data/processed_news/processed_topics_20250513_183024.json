        "summary": "\n\n\n\nRepublicans want to stop states from regulating AI. On Sunday, a Republican-led House committee submitted a budget reconciliation bill that proposes blocking states from enforcing \u201cany law or regulation\u201d targeting an exceptionally broad range of automated computing systems for 10 years after the law is enacted \u2014 a move that would stall efforts to regulate everything from AI chatbots to online search results.\u00a0\nDemocrats are calling the new provision a \u201cgiant gift\u201d to Big Tech, and organizations that promote AI oversight, like Americans for Responsible Innovation (ARI), say it could have \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d for the public. It\u2019s a gift companies like OpenAI have recently been seeking in Washington, aiming to avoid a slew of pending and active state laws. The budget reconciliation process allows lawmakers to fast-track bills related to government spending by requiring only a majority in the Senate rather than 60 votes to pass.\u00a0\nThis bill, introduced by House Committee on Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-KY), would prevent states from imposing \u201clegal impediments\u201d \u2014\u00a0or restrictions to design, performance, civil liability, and documentation \u2014 on AI models and \u201cautomated decision\u201d systems. It defines the latter category as \u201cany computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues a simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, to materially influence or replace human decision making.\u201d\nThat means the 10-year moratorium could extend well beyond AI. Travis Hall, the director for state engagement at the Center for Democracy & Technology, tells The Verge that the automated decision systems described in the bill \u201cpermeate digital services, from search results and mapping directions, to health diagnoses and risk analyses for sentencing decisions.\u201d\nDuring the 2025 legislative session, states have proposed over 500 laws that Hall says this bill could \u201cunequivocally block.\u201d They focus on everything from chatbot safety for minors to deepfake restrictions and disclosures for the use of AI in political ads. If the bill passes, the handful of states that have successfully passed AI laws may also see their efforts go to waste.\u00a0\n\u201cThe move to ban AI safeguards is a giveaway to Big Tech that will come back to bite us.\u201d\nLast year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0signed a law preventing companies from using a performer\u2019s AI-generated likeness without permission. Tennessee also adopted legislation with similar protections, while Utah has enacted a rule requiring certain businesses to disclose when customers are interacting with AI. Colorado\u2019s AI law, which goes into effect next year, will require companies developing \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI systems to protect customers from \u201calgorithmic discrimination.\u201d\nCalifornia also came close to enacting the landmark AI safety law SB 1047, which would have imposed security restrictions and legal liability on AI companies based in the state, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta. OpenAI opposed the bill, saying AI regulation should take place at the federal level instead of having a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of state laws that could make it more difficult to comply. Gov. Newsom vetoed the bill last September, and OpenAI has made it clear it wants to avoid having state laws \u201cbogging down innovation\u201d in the future.\nWith so little AI regulation at the federal level, it\u2019s been left up to the states to decide how to deal with AI.\u00a0Even before the rise of generative AI, state legislators were grappling with how to fight algorithmic discrimination \u2014 including machine learning-based systems that display race or gender bias \u2014 in areas like housing and criminal justice. Efforts to combat this, too, would likely be hampered by the Republicans\u2019 proposal.\nDemocrats have slammed the provision\u2019s inclusion in the reconciliation bill, with Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) saying the 10-year ban will \u201callow AI companies to ignore consumer privacy protections, let deepfakes spread, and allow companies to profile and deceive consumers using AI.\u201d In a statement published to X, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) said the proposal \u201cwill lead to a Dark Age for the environment, our children, and marginalized communities.\u201d\nThe nonprofit organization Americans for Responsible Innovation (ARI) compared the potential ban to the government\u2019s failure to properly regulate social media. \u201cLawmakers stalled on social media safeguards for a decade and we are still dealing with the fallout,\u201d ARI president Brad Carson said in a statement. \u201cNow apply those same harms to technology moving as fast as AI\u2026 Ultimately, the move to ban AI safeguards is a giveaway to Big Tech that will come back to bite us.\u201d\nThis provision could hit a roadblock in the Senate, as ARI notes that the Byrd rule says reconciliation bills can only focus on fiscal issues.

I found some big developments, like officers getting AI to write their police reports. Today, I published a new story that shows just how far AI for police has developed since then.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s about a new method police departments and federal agencies have found to track people: an AI tool that uses attributes like body size, gender, hair color and style, clothing, and accessories instead of faces. It offers a way around laws curbing the use of facial recognition, which are on the rise.\u00a0\nAdvocates from the ACLU, after learning of the tool through MIT Technology Review, said it was the first instance they\u2019d seen of such a tracking system used at scale in the US, and they say it has a high potential for abuse by federal agencies. They say the prospect that AI will enable more powerful surveillance is especially alarming at a time when the Trump administration is pushing for more monitoring of protesters, immigrants, and students.\u00a0\nI hope you read the full story for the details, and to watch a demo video of how the system works. But first, let\u2019s talk for a moment about what this tells us about the development of police tech and what rules, if any, these departments are subject to in the age of AI.\nAs I pointed out in my story six months ago, police departments in the US have extraordinary independence. There are more than 18,000 departments in the country, and they generally have lots of discretion over what technology they spend their budgets on. In recent years, that technology has increasingly become AI-centric.\u00a0\nCompanies like Flock and Axon sell suites of sensors\u2014cameras, license plate readers, gunshot detectors, drones\u2014and then offer AI tools to make sense of that ocean of data (at last year\u2019s conference I saw schmoozing between countless AI-for-police startups and the chiefs they sell to on the expo floor). Departments say these technologies save time, ease officer shortages, and help cut down on response times.\u00a0\nThose sound like fine goals, but this pace of adoption raises an obvious question: Who makes the rules here? When does the use of AI cross over from efficiency into surveillance, and what type of transparency is owed to the public?\nIn some cases, AI-powered police tech is already driving a wedge between departments and the communities they serve. When the police in Chula Vista, California, were the first in the country to get special waivers from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly their drones farther than normal, they said the drones would be deployed to solve crimes and get people help sooner in emergencies. They\u2019ve had some successes.\u00a0\nBut the department has also been sued by a local media outlet alleging it has reneged on its promise to make drone footage public, and residents have said the drones buzzing overhead feel like an invasion of privacy. An investigation found that these drones were deployed more often in poor neighborhoods, and for minor issues like loud music.\u00a0\nJay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU, says there\u2019s no overarching federal law that governs how local police departments adopt technologies like the tracking software I wrote about. Departments usually have the leeway to try it first, and see how their communities react after the fact. (Veritone, which makes the tool I wrote about, said they couldn\u2019t name or connect me with departments using it so the details of how it\u2019s being deployed by police are not yet clear).\u00a0\nSometimes communities take a firm stand; local laws against police use of facial recognition have been passed around the country. But departments\u2014or the police tech companies they buy from\u2014can find workarounds. Stanley says the new tracking software I wrote about poses lots of the same issues as facial recognition while escaping scrutiny because it doesn\u2019t technically use biometric data.\n\u201cThe community should be very skeptical of this kind of tech and, at a minimum, ask a lot of questions,\u201d he says. He laid out a road map of what police departments should do before they adopt AI technologies: have hearings with the public, get community permission, and make promises about how the systems will and will not be used. He added that the companies making this tech should also allow it to be tested by independent parties.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is all coming down the pike,\u201d he says\u2014and so quickly that policymakers and the public have little time to keep up.

        "summary": "Police and federal agencies have found a controversial new way to skirt the growing patchwork of laws that curb how they use facial recognition: an AI model that can track people using attributes like body size, gender, hair color and style, clothing, and accessories.\u00a0\nThe tool, called Track and built by the video analytics company Veritone, is used by 400 customers, including state and local police departments and universities all over the US. It is also expanding federally: US attorneys at the Department of Justice began using Track for criminal investigations last August. Veritone\u2019s broader suite of AI tools, which includes bona fide facial recognition, is also used by the Department of Homeland Security\u2014which houses immigration agencies\u2014and the Department of Defense, according to the company.\u00a0\n\u201cThe whole vision behind Track in the first place,\u201d says Veritone CEO Ryan Steelberg, was \u201cif we\u2019re not allowed to track people\u2019s faces, how do we assist in trying to potentially identify criminals or malicious behavior or activity?\u201d In addition to tracking individuals where facial recognition isn\u2019t legally allowed, Steelberg says, it allows for tracking when faces are obscured or not visible.\u00a0\nThe product has drawn criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union, which\u2014after learning of the tool through MIT Technology Review\u2014said it was the first instance they\u2019d seen of a nonbiometric tracking system used at scale in the US. They warned that it raises many of the same privacy concerns as facial recognition but also introduces new ones at a time when the Trump administration is pushing federal agencies to ramp up monitoring of protesters, immigrants, and students.\nVeritone gave us a demonstration of Track in which it analyzed people in footage from different environments, ranging from the January 6 riots to subway stations. You can use it to find people by specifying body size, gender, hair color and style, shoes, clothing, and various accessories. The tool can then assemble timelines, tracking a person across different locations and video feeds. It can be accessed through Amazon and Microsoft cloud platforms.\nVERITONE; MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW (CAPTIONS)\n\nIn an interview, Steelberg said that the number of attributes Track uses to identify people will continue to grow. When asked if Track differentiates on the basis of skin tone, a company spokesperson said it\u2019s one of the attributes the algorithm uses to tell people apart but that the software does not currently allow users to search for people by skin color. Track currently operates only on recorded video, but Steelberg claims the company is less than a year from being able to run it on live video feeds.\nAgencies using Track can add footage from police body cameras, drones, public videos on YouTube, or so-called citizen upload footage (from Ring cameras or cell phones, for example) in response to police requests. \n\u201cWe like to call this our Jason Bourne app,\u201d Steelberg says. He expects the technology to come under scrutiny in court cases but says, \u201cI hope we\u2019re exonerating people as much as we\u2019re helping police find the bad guys.\u201d The public sector currently accounts for only 6% of Veritone\u2019s business (most of its clients are media and entertainment companies), but the company says that\u2019s its fastest-growing market, with clients in places including California, Washington, Colorado, New Jersey, and Illinois.\u00a0\nThat rapid expansion has started to cause alarm in certain quarters. Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU, wrote in 2019 that artificial intelligence would someday expedite the tedious task of combing through surveillance footage, enabling automated analysis regardless of whether a crime has occurred. Since then, lots of police-tech companies have been building video analytics systems that can, for example, detect when a person enters a certain area. However, Stanley says, Track is the first product he\u2019s seen make broad tracking of particular people technologically feasible at scale.\n\u201cThis is a potentially authoritarian technology,\u201d he says. \u201cOne that gives great powers to the police and the government that will make it easier for them, no doubt, to solve certain crimes, but will also make it easier for them to overuse this technology, and to potentially abuse it.\u201d\nChances of such abusive surveillance, Stanley says, are particularly high right now in the federal agencies where Veritone has customers. The Department of Homeland Security said last month that it will monitor the social media activities of immigrants and use evidence it finds there to deny visas and green cards, and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has detained activists following pro-Palestinian statements or appearances at protests.\u00a0\nIn an interview, Jon Gacek, general manager of Veritone\u2019s public-sector business, said that Track is a \u201cculling tool\u201d meant to speed up the task of identifying important parts of videos, not a general surveillance tool. Veritone did not specify which groups within the Department of Homeland Security or other federal agencies use Track.\u00a0The Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. \nFor police departments, the tool dramatically expands the amount of video that can be used in investigations. Whereas facial recognition requires footage in which faces are clearly visible, Track doesn\u2019t have that limitation. Nathan Wessler, an attorney for the ACLU, says this means police might comb through videos they had no interest in before.\u00a0\n\u201cIt creates a categorically new scale and nature of privacy invasion and potential for abuse that was literally not possible any time before in human history,\u201d Wessler says. \u201cYou\u2019re now talking about not speeding up what a cop could do, but creating a capability that no cop ever had before.\u201d\nTrack\u2019s expansion comes as laws limiting the use of facial recognition have spread, sparked by wrongful arrests in which officers have been overly confident in the judgments of algorithms.\u00a0 Numerous studies have shown that such algorithms are less accurate with nonwhite faces. Laws in Montana and Maine sharply limit when police can use it\u2014it\u2019s not allowed in real time with live video\u2014while San Francisco and Oakland, California have near-complete bans on facial recognition. Track provides an alternative.\u00a0\nThough such laws often reference \u201cbiometric data,\u201d Wessler says this phrase is far from clearly defined. It generally refers to immutable characteristics like faces, gait and fingerprints rather than things that change, like clothing. But certain attributes, such as body size, blur this distinction.\u00a0\nConsider also, Wessler says, someone in winter who frequently wears the same boots, coat, and backpack. \u201cTheir profile is going to be the same day after day,\u201d Wessler says. \u201cThe potential to track somebody over time based on how they\u2019re moving across a whole bunch of different saved video feeds is pretty equivalent to face recognition.\u201d\nIn other words, Track might provide a way of following someone that raises many of the same concerns as facial recognition, but isn\u2019t subject to laws restricting use of facial recognition because it does not technically involve biometric data. Steelberg said there are several ongoing cases that include video evidence from Track, but that he couldn\u2019t name the cases or comment further. So for now, it\u2019s unclear whether it\u2019s being adopted in jurisdictions where facial recognition is banned.\u00a0",
