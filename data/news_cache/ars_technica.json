One of the most popular infostealers worldwide, Lumma has been used by hundreds of what Microsoft calls \u201ccyber threat actors\u201d to steal passwords, credit card and banking information, and cryptocurrency wallet details. The tool, which officials say is developed in Russia, has provided cybercriminals with the information and credentials they needed to drain bank accounts, disrupt services, and carry out data extortion attacks against schools, among other things.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) obtained an order from a United States district court last week to seize and take down about 2,300 domains underpinning Lumma\u2019s infrastructure. At the same time, the US Department of Justice seized Lumma\u2019s command and control infrastructure and disrupted cybercriminal marketplaces that sold the Lumma malware. All of this was coordinated, too, with the disruption of regional Lumma infrastructure by Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Center and Japan\u2019s Cybercrime Control Center.\nMicrosoft lawyers wrote on Wednesday that Lumma, which is also known as LummaC2, has spread so broadly because it is \u201ceasy to distribute, difficult to detect, and can be programmed to bypass certain security defenses.\u201d Steven Masada, assistant general counsel at Microsoft\u2019s DCU, says in a blog post that Lumma is a \u201cgo-to tool,\u201d including for the notorious Scattered Spider cybercriminal gang.

This group of physicists based in Paris noted a marked similarity between the frilly edges of those cheese flowers and certain leaves, fungi, corals, and even torn plastic sheets\u2014all formed by different mechanisms.

It's made from raw unpasteurized cow's milk and is matured for a minimum of 75 days on spruce boards and boasts a firm reddish-brown crust.
