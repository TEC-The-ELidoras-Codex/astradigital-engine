Scientists at Virginia Tech have created an improved version of their earlier \"fog harp\" alternative design to address that issue, according to a new paper published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry A.\nFog harvesting (or dew catching) is an ancient practice dating as far back as the Incas, who placed buckets under trees to collect condensation. It's also practiced by certain insects, notably Namib desert beetles, which survive on the water that condenses onto their wings. The wings have alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions to enhance the condensation. Today's fog harvesters are usually mesh nets mounted onto frames with a trough or basin underneath. Like the beetle's wings, the mesh filaments are chemically coated to be either hydrophobic or hydrophilic.\nThe efficiency of these water harvesters depends on decreasing the size of the filaments and the mesh holes. \"If the holes were too big, the microscopic droplets would pass through it, and it wouldn't harvest much water,\" co-author James Kaindu, a student in researcher Jonathan Boreyko's lab at Virginia Tech, told Ars. The trade-off is that smaller filaments and holes are more prone to clogging. \"If it was too small, the droplets would coalesce and create a water film on it,\" said Kaindu. \"It would impede the flow and act as a barrier that would dramatically affect its capture efficiency.\"Read full article\nComments",

The province's economy minister, Christine Fr\u00e9chette, said the investment will allow the company to begin launching microsatellites into orbit from Canada as early as 2027.Read full article\nComments",
    "content": "Welcome to Edition 7.48 of the Rocket Report! The shock of last week's public spat between President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk has worn off, and Musk expressed regret for some of his comments going after Trump on social media. Musk also backtracked from his threat to begin decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, currently the only way for the US government to send people to the International Space Station. Nevertheless, there are many people who think Musk's attachment to Trump could end up putting the US space program at risk, and I'm not convinced that danger has passed.\nAs always, we welcome reader submissions. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuebec invests in small launch company.
