In these systems, exoplanets tend to be found at greater distances, in orbits that have them circling both stars.\nOn Wednesday, scientists described a system that seems to be neither of the above. It is a tight binary system, with a heavy central star that's orbited by a white dwarf at a distance two to three times larger than Earth's orbit. The lone planet confirmed to be in the system is squeezed in between the two, orbiting at a distance similar to Earth's distance from the Sun.

It's orbited by a far dimmer companion that's roughly half of our Sun's mass, but which hasn't been characterized in detail until now. The companion's orbit relative to the central star is a bit lopsided, ranging from about two astronomical units (AU, the typical Earth-Sun distance) at its closest approach to roughly three AU at its farthest.

Would the lower-priced bike, with different versions of some of the same hardware, suffer compared to its beefier brethren?\nShort answer: not really. The Medeo T9 City isn't trying to dominate the road; it just wants to get you where you're going. It has the same kind of automatic electric assist level shifting, just packed into a smaller handlebar display instead of a center console. It's has chain and gear cogs instead of the Eclipse's belt drive and stepless shifting, an external battery instead of an inline, and a 250-watt Bosch Active Line motor instead of a 350-watt Performance Line Speed.\nI think the Medeo T9 City likely makes for a good first or second e-bike, or perhaps a nice upgrade if you're prioritizing comfort and transport.

New car sales were essentially flat in the region last month, with just under 1,400 more cars sold this year than last. But the market is far from static; plug-in sales are booming, with battery electric vehicle registrations up by 28 percent according to the analysts at JATO Dynamics, and plug-in hybrid EV sales increased by 31 percent. Almost every automaker has capitalized on this growth, with a few exceptions\u2014Tesla being the most significant.\nAs the first mainstream BEV-only brand, Tesla led the way in European EV sales and made much of the fact that its Model Y crossover was the best-selling car in Europe for some time. Those days are long gone. Model Y registrations fell by 53 percent last month to just 4,495 units, dropping it to 9th on the list of most-registered BEVs.

    "content": "The extent of Tesla's meteoric decline in popularity is on vivid display in the latest new car registration numbers coming out of Europe. New car sales were essentially flat in the region last month, with just under 1,400 more cars sold this year than last. But the market is far from static; plug-in sales are booming, with battery electric vehicle registrations up by 28 percent according to the analysts at JATO Dynamics, and plug-in hybrid EV sales increased by 31 percent.

    "summary": "Cheese connoisseurs are no doubt familiar with a particular kind of semi-hard Swiss cheese called \"T\u00eate de Moine.\" Rather than spreading or slicing the cheese, T\u00eate de Moine is usually served by scraping the top of the cheese wheel in a circular motion using a specialized tool called a Girolle. This produces elegant thin shavings known as rosettes, since they resemble a frilly flower.\nThe method is both aesthetically pleasing and serves to enhance the aromas and mouth feel of the cheese, according to the authors of a new paper published in the journal Physical Review Letters (PRL). This group of physicists based in Paris noted a marked similarity between the frilly edges of those cheese flowers and certain leaves, fungi, corals, and even torn plastic sheets\u2014all formed by different mechanisms. So naturally the physicists decided to conduct their own research to determine the underlying mechanism(s) for the delicate frills of T\u00eate de Moine shavings.\nT\u00eate de Moine translates as \"monk's head,\" and the name dates back to the 1790s, although the actual cheese originates back to a 12th-century Bellelay monastery in Switzerland. It's made from raw unpasteurized cow's milk and is matured for a minimum of 75 days on spruce boards and boasts a firm reddish-brown crust. The Girolle (named after the French word for chanterelles, which have a similar rosette shape) is a more recent innovation, invented in 1982 specifically for T\u00eate de Moine by a man named Nicolas Crevoisier.
