    "summary": "IBM announced detailed plans today to build an error-corrected quantum computer with significantly more computational capability than existing machines by 2028. It hopes to make the computer available to users via the cloud by 2029.\u00a0\nThe proposed machine, named Starling, will consist of a network of modules, each of which contains a set of chips, housed within a new data center in Poughkeepsie, New York. \u201cWe\u2019ve already started building the space,\u201d says Jay Gambetta, vice president of IBM\u2019s quantum initiative.\nIBM claims Starling will be a leap forward in quantum computing. In particular, the company aims for it to be the first large-scale machine to implement error correction. If Starling achieves this, IBM will have solved arguably the biggest technical hurdle facing the industry today to beat competitors including Google, Amazon Web Services, and smaller startups such as Boston-based QuEra and PsiQuantum of Palo Alto, California.\u00a0\nIBM, along with the rest of the industry, has years of work ahead. But Gambetta thinks it has an edge because it has all the building blocks to build error correction capabilities in a large-scale machine. That means improvements in everything from algorithm development to chip packaging. \u201cWe\u2019ve cracked the code for quantum error correction, and now we\u2019ve moved from science to engineering,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nCorrecting errors in a quantum computer has been an engineering challenge, owing to the unique way the machines crunch numbers. Whereas classical computers encode information in the form of bits, or binary 1 and 0, quantum computers instead use qubits, which can represent \u201csuperpositions\u201d of both values at once. IBM builds qubits made of tiny superconducting circuits, kept near absolute zero, in an interconnected layout on chips. Other companies have built qubits out of other materials, including neutral atoms, ions, and photons.\nQuantum computers sometimes commit errors, such as when the hardware operates on one qubit but accidentally also alters a neighboring qubit that should not be involved in the computation. These errors add up over time. Without error correction, quantum computers cannot accurately perform the complex algorithms that are expected to be the source of their scientific or commercial value, such as extremely precise chemistry simulations for discovering new materials and pharmaceutical drugs.\u00a0\nBut error correction requires significant hardware overhead. Instead of encoding a single unit of information in a single \u201cphysical\u201d qubit, error correction algorithms encode a unit of information in a constellation of physical qubits, referred to collectively as a \u201clogical qubit.\u201d \nCurrently, quantum computing researchers are competing to develop the best error correction scheme. Google\u2019s surface code algorithm, while effective at correcting errors, requires on the order of 100 qubits to store a single logical qubit in memory. AWS\u2019s Ocelot quantum computer uses a more efficient error correction scheme that requires nine physical qubits per logical qubit in memory. (The overhead is higher for qubits performing computations for storing data.) IBM\u2019s error correction algorithm, known as a low-density parity check code, will make it possible to use 12 physical qubits per logical qubit in memory, a ratio comparable to AWS\u2019s.\u00a0\nOne distinguishing characteristic of Starling\u2019s design will be its anticipated ability to diagnose errors, known as decoding, in real time. Decoding involves determining whether a measured signal from the quantum computer corresponds to an error. IBM has developed a decoding algorithm that can be quickly executed by a type of conventional chip known as an FPGA. This work bolsters the \u201ccredibility\u201d of IBM\u2019s error correction method, says Neil Gillespie of the UK-based quantum computing startup Riverlane.\u00a0\nHowever, other error correction schemes and hardware designs aren\u2019t out of the running yet. \u201cIt\u2019s still not clear what the winning architecture is going to be,\u201d says Gillespie.\u00a0\nIBM intends Starling to be able to perform computational tasks beyond the capability of classical computers. Starling will have 200 logical qubits, which will be constructed using the company\u2019s chips. It should be able to perform 100 million logical operations consecutively with accuracy; existing quantum computers can do so for only a few thousand.\u00a0\nThe system will demonstrate error correction at a much larger scale than anything done before, claims Gambetta. Previous error correction demonstrations, such as those done by Google and Amazon, involve a single logical qubit, built from a single chip. Gambetta calls them \u201cgadget experiments,\u201d saying \u201cThey\u2019re small-scale.\u201d\u00a0\nStill, it\u2019s unclear whether Starling will be able to solve practical problems. Some experts think that you need a billion error-corrected logical operations to execute any useful algorithm. Starling represents \u201can interesting stepping-stone regime,\u201d says Wolfgang Pfaff, a physicist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. \u201cBut it\u2019s unlikely that this will generate economic value.\u201d (Pfaff, who studies quantum computing hardware, has received research funding from IBM but is not involved with Starling.)\u00a0\nThe timeline for Starling looks feasible, according to Pfaff. The design is \u201cbased in experimental and engineering reality,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve come up with something that looks pretty compelling.\u201d But building a quantum computer is hard, and it\u2019s possible that IBM will encounter delays due to unforeseen technical complications. \u201cThis is the first time someone\u2019s doing this,\u201d he says of making a large-scale error-corrected quantum computer.\nIBM\u2019s road map involves first building smaller machines before Starling. This year, it plans to demonstrate that error-corrected information can be stored robustly in a chip called Loon. Next year the company will build Kookaburra, a module that can both store information and perform computations. By the end of 2027, it plans to connect two Kookaburra-type modules together into a larger quantum computer, Cockatoo. After demonstrating that successfully, the next step is to scale up and connect around 100 modules to create Starling.\nThis strategy, says Pfaff, reflects the industry\u2019s recent embrace of \u201cmodularity\u201d when scaling up quantum computers\u2014networking multiple modules together to create a larger quantum computer rather than laying out qubits on a single chip, as researchers did in earlier designs.\u00a0\nIBM is also looking beyond 2029. After Starling, it plans to build another, Blue Jay. (\u201cI like birds,\u201d says Gambetta.) Blue Jay will contain 2000 logical qubits and is expected to be capable of a billion logical operations.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration\u2019s chainsaw approach to federal spending lives on, even as Elon Musk turns on the president. On May 28, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced he\u2019d be gutting a key office at the Department of Defense responsible for testing and evaluating the safety of weapons and AI systems.\nAs part of a string of moves aimed at \u201creducing bloated bureaucracy and wasteful spending in favor of increased lethality,\u201d Hegseth cut the size of the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation in half. The group was established in the 1980s\u2014following orders from Congress\u2014after criticisms that the Pentagon was fielding weapons and systems that didn\u2019t perform as safely or effectively as advertised. Hegseth is reducing the agency\u2019s staff to about 45, down from 94, and firing and replacing its director. He gave the office just seven days to implement the changes.\nIt is a significant overhaul of a department that in 40 years has never before been placed so squarely on the chopping block. Here\u2019s how today\u2019s defense tech companies, which have fostered close connections to the Trump administration, stand to gain, and why safety testing might suffer as a result.\u00a0\nThe Operational Test and Evaluation office is \u201cthe last gate before a technology gets to the field,\u201d says Missy Cummings, a former fighter pilot for the US Navy who is now a professor of engineering and computer science at George Mason University. Though the military can do small experiments with new systems without running it by the office, it has to test anything that gets fielded at scale.\n\u201cIn a bipartisan way\u2014up until now\u2014everybody has seen it\u2019s working to help reduce waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d she says. That\u2019s because it provides an independent check on companies\u2019 and contractors\u2019 claims about how well their technology works.

    "content": "The Trump administration\u2019s chainsaw approach to federal spending lives on, even as Elon Musk turns on the president. On May 28, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced he\u2019d be gutting a key office at the Department of Defense responsible for testing and evaluating the safety of weapons and AI systems.\nAs part of a string of moves aimed at \u201creducing bloated bureaucracy and wasteful spending in favor of increased lethality,\u201d Hegseth cut the size of the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation in half. The group was established in the 1980s\u2014following orders from Congress\u2014after criticisms that the Pentagon was fielding weapons and systems that didn\u2019t perform as safely or effectively as advertised. Hegseth is reducing the agency\u2019s staff to about 45, down from 94, and firing and replacing its director. He gave the office just seven days to implement the changes.\nIt is a significant overhaul of a department that in 40 years has never before been placed so squarely on the chopping block. Here\u2019s how today\u2019s defense tech companies, which have fostered close connections to the Trump administration, stand to gain, and why safety testing might suffer as a result.\u00a0\nThe Operational Test and Evaluation office is \u201cthe last gate before a technology gets to the field,\u201d says Missy Cummings, a former fighter pilot for the US Navy who is now a professor of engineering and computer science at George Mason University. Though the military can do small experiments with new systems without running it by the office, it has to test anything that gets fielded at scale.\n\u201cIn a bipartisan way\u2014up until now\u2014everybody has seen it\u2019s working to help reduce waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d she says. That\u2019s because it provides an independent check on companies\u2019 and contractors\u2019 claims about how well their technology works. It also aims to expose the systems to more rigorous safety testing.\nThe gutting comes at a particularly pivotal time for AI and military adoption: The Pentagon is experimenting with putting AI into everything, mainstream companies like OpenAI are now more comfortable working with the military, and defense giants like Anduril are winning big contracts to launch AI systems (last Thursday, Anduril announced a whopping $2.5 billion funding round, doubling its valuation to over $30 billion).\u00a0\nHegseth claims his cuts will \u201cmake testing and fielding weapons more efficient,\u201d saving $300 million.

Some new research suggests that people with heart conditions have better outcomes when they are more hopeful and optimistic.

In the meantime, many are developing ways to harness it in hospital settings. Is it possible for a doctor to prescribe hope?\nAlexander Montasem, a lecturer in psychology at the University of Liverpool, is trying to find an answer to that question. In his latest study, Montasem and his colleagues focused on people with cardiovascular disease.\nThe team reviewed all published research into the link between hope and heart health outcomes in such individuals. Hope is a pretty tricky thing to nail down, but these studies use questionnaires to try to do that. In\u00a0one popular questionnaire, hope is defined as \u201ca positive motivational state\u201d based on having agency and plans to meet personal goals.\nMontasem\u2019s team found 12 studies that fit the bill. All told, these studies included over 5,000 people. And together, they found that high hopefulness was associated with better health outcomes: less angina, less post-stroke fatigue, a higher quality of life, and a lower risk of death. The team presented its work at\u00a0the British Cardiovascular Society meeting in Manchester earlier this week.\nWhen I read the results, it immediately got me thinking about the placebo effect. A placebo is a \u201csham\u201d treatment\u2014an inert substance like a sugar pill or saline injection that does not contain any medicine. And yet hundreds of studies have shown that such treatments can have remarkable effects.\nThey can ease the symptoms of pain, migraine, Parkinson\u2019s disease, depression, anxiety, and a host of other disorders. The way a placebo is delivered can influence its effectiveness, and so can its color, shape, and price.\u00a0Expensive placebos seem to be more effective. And placebos\u00a0can even work when people know they are just placebos.\nAnd then there\u2019s the nocebo effect. If you expect to feel worse after taking something, you are much more likely to. The nocebo effect can\u00a0increase the risk of pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, flu-like symptoms, and more.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s obvious our thoughts and beliefs can play an enormous role in our health and well-being. What\u2019s less clear is exactly how it happens. Scientists have made some progress\u2014there\u2019s evidence that\u00a0a range of brain chemicals, including the body\u2019s own opioids, are involved in both the placebo and nocebo effects. But the exact mechanisms remain something of a mystery.\nIn the meantime, researchers are working on ways to harness the power of positive thinking. There have been long-running debates over\u00a0whether it is ever ethical for a doctor to deceive patients to make them feel better. But I\u2019m firmly of the belief that doctors have a duty to be honest with their patients.\nA more ethical approach might be to find ways to build patients\u2019 hope, says Montasem. Not by exaggerating the likely benefit of a drug or by sugar-coating a prognosis, but perhaps by helping them work on their goals, agency, and general outlook on life.\nSome early research suggests that this approach can help. Laurie McLouth at the University of Kentucky and her colleagues found that a series of discussions about values, goals, and strategies to achieve those goals\u00a0improved hope among people being treated for advanced lung cancer.\nMontasem now plans to review all the published work in this area and design a new approach to increasing hope. Any approach might have to be tailored to an individual, he adds. Some people might be more responsive to a more spiritual or religious way of thinking about their lives, for example.\nThese approaches could also be helpful for all of us, even outside clinical settings. I asked Montasem if he had any advice for people who want to have a positive outlook on life more generally. He told me that it\u2019s important to have personal goals, along with a plan to achieve them. His own goals center on advancing his research, helping patients, and spending time with his family. \u201cMaterialistic goals aren\u2019t as beneficial for your wellbeing,\u201d he adds.\nSince we spoke, I\u2019ve been thinking over my own goals.

    "summary": "Later this month, an inconspicuous 150-kilogram satellite is set to launch into space aboard the SpaceX Transporter 14 mission. Once in orbit, it will test super-accurate next-generation satnav technology designed to make up for the shortcomings of the US Global Positioning System (GPS).\u00a0\nThe satellite is the first of a planned constellation called Pulsar, which is being developed by California-based Xona Space Systems. The company ultimately plans to have a constellation of 258 satellites in low Earth orbit. Although these satellites will operate much like those used to create GPS, they will orbit about 12,000 miles closer to Earth\u2019s surface, beaming down a much stronger signal that\u2019s more accurate\u2014and harder to jam.\u00a0\n\u201cJust because of this shorter distance, we will put down signals that will be approximately a hundred times stronger than the GPS signal,\u201d says Tyler Reid, chief technology officer and cofounder of Xona. \u201cThat means the reach of jammers will be much smaller against our system, but we will also be able to reach deeper into indoor locations, penetrating through multiple walls.\u201d\nA satnav system for the 21st century\nThe first GPS system went live in 1993. In the decades since, it has become one of the foundational technologies that the world depends on. The precise positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) signals beamed by its\u00a0 satellites underpin much more than Google Maps in your phone. They guide drill heads at offshore oil rigs, time-stamp financial transactions, and help sync power grids all over the world.\nBut despite the system\u2019s indispensable nature, the GPS signal is easily suppressed or disrupted by everything from space weather to 5G cell towers to phone-size jammers worth a few tens of dollars. The problem has been whispered about among experts for years, but it has really come to the fore in the last three years, since Russia invaded Ukraine. The boom in drone warfare that came to characterize that war also triggered a race to develop technology for thwarting drone attacks by jamming the GPS signals they need to navigate\u2014or spoofing the signal, creating convincing but fake positioning data.\u00a0\nThe crucial problem is one of distance: The GPS constellation, which consists of 24 satellites plus a handful of spares, orbits 12,550 miles (20,200 kilometers) above Earth, in a region known as medium Earth orbit. By the time their signals get all the way down to ground-based receivers, they are so faint that they can easily be overridden by jammers.\nOther existing Global Navigation Satellite System constellations, such as Europe\u2019s Galileo, Russia\u2019s GLONASS, and China\u2019s Beidou, have similar architectures and experience the same problems.\nBut when Reid and cofounder Brian Manning founded Xona Space Systems in 2019, they didn\u2019t think about jamming and spoofing. Their goal was to make autonomous driving ready for prime time.\u00a0\n\nXona Space System\u2019s completed Pulsar-0 satellite is launching this June.AEROSPACELAB\n\n\nDozens of robocars from Uber and Waymo were already cruising American freeways at that time, equipped with expensive suites of sensors like high-resolution cameras and lidar. The engineers figured a more precise satellite navigation system could reduce the need for those sensors, making it possible to create a safe autonomous vehicle affordable enough to go mainstream. One day, cars might even be able to share their positioning data with one another, Reid says. But they knew that GPS was nowhere near accurate enough to keep self-driving cars within the lane lines and away from other objects on the road. That is especially true in densely built-up urban environments that provide many chances for signals to bounce off walls, creating errors.\n\u201cGPS has the superpower of being a ubiquitous system that works the same anywhere in the world,\u201d Reid says. \u201cBut it\u2019s a system that was designed primarily to support military missions, virtually to enable them to drop five bombs in the same bowl. But this meter-level accuracy is not enough to guide machines where they need to go and share that physical space with humans safely.\u201d\nReid and Manning began to think about how to build a space-based PNT system that would do what GPS does but better, with accuracy of three inches (10 centimeters) or less and ironclad reliability in all sorts of challenging conditions.\nThe easiest way to do that is to bring the satellites closer to Earth so that data reaches receivers in real time without inaccuracy-causing delays. The stronger signal of satellites in low Earth orbit is more resistant to disruptions of all sorts.\u00a0\nWhen GPS was conceived, none of that was possible. Constellations in low Earth orbit\u2014altitudes up to 1,200 miles (2,000 km)\u2014require hundreds of satellites to provide constant coverage over the entire globe. For a long time, space technology was too bulky and expensive to make such large constellations viable. Over the past decade, however, smaller electronics and lower launch costs have changed the equation.\n\u201cIn 2019, when we started, the ecosystem of low Earth orbit was really exploding,\u201d Reid says. \u201cWe could see things like Starlink, OneWeb, and other constellations take off.\u201d\nMatter of urgency\nIn the few years since Xona launched, concerns about GPS\u2019s vulnerability have begun to grow amid rising geopolitical tensions. As a result, finding a reliable replacement has become a matter of strategic importance.\u00a0\nIn Ukraine especially, GPS jamming and spoofing have become so common that prized US precision munitions such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System became effectively blind. Makers of first-person-view drones, which came to symbolize the war, had to refocus on AI-driven autonomous navigation to keep those drones in the game.\u00a0\nThe problem quickly spilled beyond Ukraine. Countries bordering Russia, such as Finland and Estonia, complained that the increasing prevalence of GPS jamming and spoofing was affecting commercial flights and ships in the region.\nBut Cl\u00e9mence Poirier, a space security researcher at ETH Zurich, says that the problem of GPS disruption isn\u2019t limited to the vicinity of war zones.\n\u201cBasic jammers are very cheap and super easily accessible to everyone online,\u201d Poirier says. \u201cEven with the simplest ones, which can be the size of your phone, you can disrupt GPS signals in [an] area of a hundred or more meters.\u201d\nIn 2013, a truck driver using such a device to conceal his location from his boss accidently disrupted GPS signals around the Newark airport in New Jersey. In 2022, the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport reported a 24-hour GPS outage, which prompted a temporary closure of one of its runways. The source of the interference was never identified. That same year, Denver International Airport experienced a 33-hour GPS disruption.\u00a0\nRace to securing PNT\n\u201cXona is a promising solution to enhance the resilience of GPS-dependent critical infrastructures and mitigate the threat of GPS jamming and spoofing,\u201d Poirier says. But, she adds, there is no \u201cmagic wand,\u201d and a \u201cvariety of different approaches will be needed\u201d to solve the problem.\nAnd indeed, Xona is not the only company hoping to provide a backup for the indispensable yet increasingly vulnerable GPS. Companies such as Anello Photonics, based in Santa Clara, California, and Sydney-based Advanced Navigation are testing terrestrial solutions: inertial navigation devices that are small and affordable enough for use beyond high-end military tech. These systems rely on gyroscopes and accelerometers to deduce a vehicle\u2019s position from its own motions.\u00a0\nWhen integrated into PNT receivers, these technologies can help detect GPS spoofing and take over for the duration of the interference. Inertial navigation has been around for decades, but recent advances in photonic technologies and microelectromechanical systems have brought it into the mainstream.\nThe French aerospace and defense conglomerate Safran is developing a system that distributes PNT data via\u00a0 optical-fiber networks, which form the backbone of the global internet infrastructure. But the allure of space remains strong: The ability to reach any place at any time is what turned GPS from an obscure military system into a piece of taken-for-granted infrastructure that most people today can hardly live without.\nAnd Xona could have some space-based competition. Virginia-based TrustPoint is currently raising funds to build its own low-Earth-orbit PNT constellation, and some have proposed that signals from SpaceX\u2019s Starlink could be repurposed to provide PNT services as well.\nXona hopes to secure its spot in the market by designing its signal to be compatible with that of GPS, allowing manufacturers of GPS receivers to easily slot the new constellation into existing tech.\u00a0\nAlthough it will take at least until 2030 for the entire constellation to be up and running, Reid says Xona\u2019s system will provide a valuable addition to the existing GPS infrastructure as soon as 16 of its satellites are in orbit.\u00a0\nThe upcoming launch comes three years after a demonstration mission known as Huginn tested the basics of the technology. The new satellite, called Pulsar-0, will be used to see how well the system can resist jamming or spoofing.\nXona plans to launch an additional four spacecraft next year and hopes to have most of the constellation deployed by 2030.\u00a0\n",

These systems rely on gyroscopes and accelerometers to deduce a vehicle\u2019s position from its own motions.\u00a0\nWhen integrated into PNT receivers, these technologies can help detect GPS spoofing and take over for the duration of the interference. Inertial navigation has been around for decades, but recent advances in photonic technologies and microelectromechanical systems have brought it into the mainstream.\nThe French aerospace and defense conglomerate Safran is developing a system that distributes PNT data via\u00a0 optical-fiber networks, which form the backbone of the global internet infrastructure. But the allure of space remains strong: The ability to reach any place at any time is what turned GPS from an obscure military system into a piece of taken-for-granted infrastructure that most people today can hardly live without.\nAnd Xona could have some space-based competition. Virginia-based TrustPoint is currently raising funds to build its own low-Earth-orbit PNT constellation, and some have proposed that signals from SpaceX\u2019s Starlink could be repurposed to provide PNT services as well.\nXona hopes to secure its spot in the market by designing its signal to be compatible with that of GPS, allowing manufacturers of GPS receivers to easily slot the new constellation into existing tech.\u00a0\nAlthough it will take at least until 2030 for the entire constellation to be up and running, Reid says Xona\u2019s system will provide a valuable addition to the existing GPS infrastructure as soon as 16 of its satellites are in orbit.\u00a0\nThe upcoming launch comes three years after a demonstration mission known as Huginn tested the basics of the technology. The new satellite, called Pulsar-0, will be used to see how well the system can resist jamming or spoofing.\nXona plans to launch an additional four spacecraft next year and hopes to have most of the constellation deployed by 2030.\u00a0\n"

    "summary": "Last year, China saw a boom in foundation models, the do-everything large language models that underpin the AI revolution. This year, the focus has shifted to AI agents\u2014systems that are less about responding to users\u2019 queries and more about autonomously accomplishing things for them.\u00a0\nThere are now a host of Chinese startups building these general-purpose digital tools, which can answer emails, browse the internet to plan vacations, and even design an interactive website. Many of these have emerged in just the last two months, following in the footsteps of Manus\u2014a general AI agent that sparked weeks of social media frenzy for invite codes after its limited-release launch in early March.\u00a0\nThese emerging AI agents aren\u2019t large language models themselves. Instead, they\u2019re built on top of them, using a workflow-based structure designed to get things done. A lot of these systems also introduce a different way of interacting with AI. Rather than just chatting back and forth with users, they are optimized for managing and executing multistep tasks\u2014booking flights, managing schedules, conducting research\u2014by using external tools and remembering instructions.\u00a0\nChina could take the lead on building these kinds of agents. The country\u2019s tightly integrated app ecosystems, rapid product cycles, and digitally fluent user base could provide a favorable environment for embedding AI into daily life.\u00a0\nFor now, its leading AI agent startups are focusing their attention on the global market, because the best Western models don\u2019t operate inside China\u2019s firewalls. But that could change soon: Tech giants like ByteDance and Tencent are preparing their own AI agents that could bake automation directly into their native super-apps, pulling data from their vast ecosystem of programs that dominate many aspects of daily life in the country.\u00a0\nAs the race to define what a useful AI agent looks like unfolds, a mix of ambitious startups and entrenched tech giants are now testing how these tools might actually work in practice\u2014and for whom.\nSet the standard\nIt\u2019s been a whirlwind few months for Manus, which was developed by the startup Butterfly Effect. The company raised $75 million in a funding round led by the US venture capital firm Benchmark, took the product on an ambitious global roadshow, and hired dozens of new employees.\u00a0\nEven before registration opened to the public in May, Manus had become a reference point for what a broad, consumer\u2011oriented AI agent should accomplish. Rather than handling narrow chores for businesses, this \u201cgeneral\u201d agent is designed to be able to help with everyday tasks like trip planning, stock comparison, or your kid\u2019s school project.\u00a0\nUnlike previous AI agents, Manus uses a browser-based sandbox that lets users supervise the agent like an intern, watching in real time as it scrolls through web pages, reads articles, or codes actions. It also proactively asks clarifying questions, supports long-term memory that would serve as context for future tasks.\n\u201cManus represents a promising product experience for AI agents,\u201d says Ang Li, cofounder and CEO of Simular, a startup based in Palo Alto, California, that\u2019s building AI agents that operate a real computer. \u201cI believe Chinese startups have a huge advantage when it comes to designing consumer products, thanks to cutthroat domestic competition that leads to fast execution and greater attention to product details.\u201d\nIn the case of Manus, the competition is moving fast. Two of the most buzzy follow\u2011ups, Genspark and Flowith, for example, are already boasting benchmark scores that match or edge past Manus\u2019s.\u00a0\nGenspark, led by former Baidu executives Eric\u202fJing and Kay\u202fZhu, links many small \u201csuper agents\u201d through what it calls multi\u2011component prompting. The agent can switch among several large language models, accepts both images and text, and carries out tasks from making slide decks to placing phone calls. Whereas Manus relies heavily on Browser Use, a popular open-source product that lets agents operate a web browser in a virtual window like a human, Genspark directly integrates with a wide array of tools and APIs. Launched in April, the company says that it already has over 5 million users and over $36 million in yearly revenue.\nFlowith, the work of a young team that first grabbed public attention in April 2025 at a developer event hosted by the popular social media app Xiaohongshu, takes a different tack. Marketed as an \u201cinfinite agent,\u201d it opens on a blank canvas where each question becomes a node on a branching map. Users can backtrack, take new branches, and store results in personal or sharable \u201cknowledge gardens\u201d\u2014a design that feels more like project management software (think Notion) than a typical chat interface. Every inquiry or task builds its own mind-map-like graph, encouraging a more nonlinear and creative interaction with AI. Flowith\u2019s core agent, NEO, runs in the cloud and can perform scheduled tasks like sending emails and compiling files. The founders want the app to be a \u201cknowledge marketbase\u201d, and aims to tap into the social aspect of AI with the aspiration of becoming \u201cthe OnlyFans of AI knowledge creators\u201d.\nWhat they also share with Manus is the global ambition. Both Genspark and Flowith have stated that their primary focus is the international market.\nA global address\nStartups like Manus, Genspark, and Flowith\u2014though founded by Chinese entrepreneurs\u2014could blend seamlessly into the global tech scene and compete effectively abroad. Founders, investors, and analysts that MIT Technology Review has spoken to believe Chinese companies are moving fast, executing well, and quickly coming up with new products.\u00a0\nMoney reinforces the pull to launch overseas. Customers there pay more, and there are plenty to go around. \u201cYou can price in USD, and with the exchange rate that\u2019s a sevenfold multiplier,\u201d Manus cofounder\u202fXiao\u202fHong quipped on a podcast. \u201cEven if we\u2019re only operating at 10% power because of cultural differences overseas, we\u2019ll still make more than in China.\u201d\nBut creating the same functionality in China is a challenge. Major US AI companies including OpenAI and Anthropic have opted out of mainland China because of geopolitical risks and challenges with regulatory compliance. Their absence initially created a black market as users resorted to VPNs and third-party mirrors to access tools like ChatGPT and Claude. That vacuum has since been filled by a new wave of Chinese chatbots\u2014DeepSeek, Doubao, Kimi\u2014but the appetite for foreign models hasn\u2019t gone away.\u00a0\nManus, for example, uses Anthropic\u2019s Claude\u202fSonnet\u2014widely considered the top model for agentic tasks. Manus cofounder\u202fZhang\u202fTao has repeatedly praised Claude\u2019s ability to juggle tools, remember contexts, and hold multi\u2011round conversations\u2014all crucial for turning chatty software into an effective executive assistant.\nBut the company\u2019s use of Sonnet has made its agent functionally unusable inside China without a VPN. If you open Manus from a mainland IP address, you\u2019ll see a notice explaining that the team is \u201cworking on integrating Qwen\u2019s model,\u201d a special local version that is built on top of Alibaba\u2019s open-source model.\u00a0\nAn engineer overseeing ByteDance\u2019s work on developing an agent, who spoke to MIT Technology Review anonymously to avoid sanction, said that the absence of Claude\u202fSonnet models \u201climits everything we do in China.\u201d DeepSeek\u2019s open models, he added, still hallucinate too often and lack training on real\u2011world workflows. Developers we spoke with rank Alibaba\u2019s Qwen series as the best domestic alternative, yet most say that switching to Qwen knocks performance down a notch.\nJiaxin\u202fPei, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford\u2019s Institute for Human\u2011Centered AI, thinks that gap will close: \u201cBuilding agentic capabilities in base LLMs has become a key focus for many LLM builders, and once people realize the value of this, it will only be a matter of time.\u201d\nFor now, Manus is doubling down on audiences it can already serve. In a written response, the company said its \u201cprimary focus is overseas expansion,\u201d noting that new offices in San Francisco, Singapore, and Tokyo have opened in the past month.\nA super\u2011app approach\nAlthough the concept of AI agents is still relatively new, the consumer-facing AI app market in China is already crowded with major tech players. DeepSeek remains the most widely used, while ByteDance\u2019s Doubao and Moonshot\u2019s Kimi have also become household names. However, most of these apps are still optimized for chat and entertainment rather than task execution. This gap in the local market has pushed China\u2019s big tech firms to roll out their own user-facing agents, though early versions remain uneven in quality and rough around the edges.\u00a0\nByteDance is testing Coze\u202fSpace, an AI agent based on its own Doubao model family that lets users toggle between \u201cplan\u201d and \u201cexecute\u201d modes, so they can either directly guide the agent\u2019s actions or step back and watch it work autonomously. It connects up to 14 popular apps, including GitHub, Notion, and the company\u2019s own Lark office suite. Early reviews say the tool can feel clunky and has a high failure rate, but it clearly aims to match what Manus offers.\nMeanwhile, Zhipu\u202fAI has released a free agent called AutoGLM\u202fRumination, built on its proprietary ChatGLM models. Shanghai\u2011based Minimax has launched Minimax\u202fAgent. Both products look almost identical to Manus and demo basic tasks such as building a simple website, planning a trip, making a small Flash game, or running quick data analysis.\nDespite the limited usability of most general AI agents launched within China, big companies have plans to change that. During a May\u202f15 earnings call, Tencent president Liu\u202fZhiping teased an agent that would weave automation directly into China\u2019s most ubiquitous app, WeChat.\u00a0\nConsidered the original super-app, WeChat already handles messaging, mobile payments, news, and millions of mini\u2011programs that act like embedded apps. These programs give Tencent, its developer, access to data from millions of services that pervade everyday life in China, an advantage most competitors can only envy.\nHistorically, China\u2019s consumer internet has splintered into competing walled gardens\u2014share a Taobao link in WeChat and it resolves as plaintext, not a preview card. Unlike the more interoperable Western internet, China\u2019s tech giants have long resisted integration with one another, choosing to wage platform war at the expense of a seamless user experience.\nBut the use of mini\u2011programs has given WeChat unprecedented reach across services that once resisted interoperability, from gym bookings to grocery orders. An agent able to roam that ecosystem could bypass the integration headaches dogging independent startups.\nAlibaba, the e-commerce giant behind the Qwen model series, has been a front-runner in China\u2019s AI race but has been slower to release consumer-facing products. Even though Qwen was the most downloaded open-source model on Hugging Face in 2024, it didn\u2019t power a dedicated chatbot app until early 2025. In March, Alibaba rebranded its cloud storage and search app Quark into an all-in-one AI search tool. By June, Quark had introduced DeepResearch\u2014a new mode that marks its most agent-like effort to date.\u00a0\nByteDance and Alibaba did not reply to MIT Technology Review\u2019s request for comments.\n\u201cHistorically, Chinese tech products tend to pursue the all-in-one, super-app approach, and the latest Chinese AI agents reflect just that,\u201d says Li of Simular, who previously worked at Google DeepMind on lifelong learning agents. \u201cIn contrast, AI agents in the US are more focused on serving specific verticals.\u201d\nPei, the researcher at Stanford, says that existing tech giants could have a huge advantage in bringing the vision of general AI agents to life\u2014especially those with built-in integration across services. \u201cThe customer-facing AI agent market is still very early, with tons of problems like authentication and liability,\u201d he says. \u201cBut companies that already operate across a wide range of services have a natural advantage in deploying agents at scale.\u201d\n",

If he goes forward, it would be the first major commercial investment in one of medicine\u2019s most fraught ideas.\nIn a post on X June 2, Armstrong announced he was looking for gene-editing scientists and bioinformatics specialists to form a founding team for an \u201cembryo editing\u201d effort targeting an unmet medical need, such as a genetic disease.\nThe announcement from a deep-pocketed backer is a striking shift for a field considered taboo following the 2018 birth of the world\u2019s first genetically edited children in China\u2014a secretive experiment that led to international outrage and prison time for the lead scientist.

That included nearly $1.3 billion for cement-related projects.Cement is a massive climate problem, accounting for roughly 7% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s a difficult industry to clean up, with huge traditional players and expensive equipment and infrastructure to replace. This funding was supposed to help address those difficulties, by supporting projects on the cusp of commercialization. Now companies will need to fill in the gap left by these cancellations, and it\u2019s a big one.
