I found some big developments, like officers getting AI to write their police reports. Today, I published a new story that shows just how far AI for police has developed since then.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s about a new method police departments and federal agencies have found to track people: an AI tool that uses attributes like body size, gender, hair color and style, clothing, and accessories instead of faces. It offers a way around laws curbing the use of facial recognition, which are on the rise.\u00a0\nAdvocates from the ACLU, after learning of the tool through MIT Technology Review, said it was the first instance they\u2019d seen of such a tracking system used at scale in the US, and they say it has a high potential for abuse by federal agencies. They say the prospect that AI will enable more powerful surveillance is especially alarming at a time when the Trump administration is pushing for more monitoring of protesters, immigrants, and students.\u00a0\nI hope you read the full story for the details, and to watch a demo video of how the system works. But first, let\u2019s talk for a moment about what this tells us about the development of police tech and what rules, if any, these departments are subject to in the age of AI.\nAs I pointed out in my story six months ago, police departments in the US have extraordinary independence. There are more than 18,000 departments in the country, and they generally have lots of discretion over what technology they spend their budgets on. In recent years, that technology has increasingly become AI-centric.\u00a0\nCompanies like Flock and Axon sell suites of sensors\u2014cameras, license plate readers, gunshot detectors, drones\u2014and then offer AI tools to make sense of that ocean of data (at last year\u2019s conference I saw schmoozing between countless AI-for-police startups and the chiefs they sell to on the expo floor). Departments say these technologies save time, ease officer shortages, and help cut down on response times.\u00a0\nThose sound like fine goals, but this pace of adoption raises an obvious question: Who makes the rules here? When does the use of AI cross over from efficiency into surveillance, and what type of transparency is owed to the public?\nIn some cases, AI-powered police tech is already driving a wedge between departments and the communities they serve. When the police in Chula Vista, California, were the first in the country to get special waivers from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly their drones farther than normal, they said the drones would be deployed to solve crimes and get people help sooner in emergencies. They\u2019ve had some successes.\u00a0\nBut the department has also been sued by a local media outlet alleging it has reneged on its promise to make drone footage public, and residents have said the drones buzzing overhead feel like an invasion of privacy. An investigation found that these drones were deployed more often in poor neighborhoods, and for minor issues like loud music.\u00a0\nJay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU, says there\u2019s no overarching federal law that governs how local police departments adopt technologies like the tracking software I wrote about. Departments usually have the leeway to try it first, and see how their communities react after the fact. (Veritone, which makes the tool I wrote about, said they couldn\u2019t name or connect me with departments using it so the details of how it\u2019s being deployed by police are not yet clear).\u00a0\nSometimes communities take a firm stand; local laws against police use of facial recognition have been passed around the country. But departments\u2014or the police tech companies they buy from\u2014can find workarounds. Stanley says the new tracking software I wrote about poses lots of the same issues as facial recognition while escaping scrutiny because it doesn\u2019t technically use biometric data.\n\u201cThe community should be very skeptical of this kind of tech and, at a minimum, ask a lot of questions,\u201d he says. He laid out a road map of what police departments should do before they adopt AI technologies: have hearings with the public, get community permission, and make promises about how the systems will and will not be used. He added that the companies making this tech should also allow it to be tested by independent parties.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is all coming down the pike,\u201d he says\u2014and so quickly that policymakers and the public have little time to keep up.

    "summary": "The CRISPR patents are back in play.\nOn Monday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said scientists Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier will get another chance to show they ought to own the key patents on what many consider the defining biotechnology invention of the 21st century. \nThe pair shared a 2020 Nobel Prize for developing the versatile gene-editing system, which is already being used to treat various genetic disorders, including sickle cell disease.\u00a0\nBut when key US patent rights were granted in 2014 to researcher Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the decision set off a bitter dispute in which hundreds of millions of dollars\u2014as well as scientific bragging rights\u2014are at stake.\nThe new decision is a boost for the Nobelists, who had previously faced a string of demoralizing reversals over the patent rights in both the US and Europe.\n\u201cThis goes to who was the first to invent, who has priority, and who is entitled to the broadest patents,\u201d says Jacob Sherkow, a law professor at the University of Illinois.\u00a0\nHe says there is now at least a chance that Doudna and Charpentier \u201ccould walk away as the clear winner.\u201d\nThe CRISPR patent battle is among the most byzantine ever, putting the technology alongside the steam engine, the telephone, the lightbulb, and the laser among the most hotly contested inventions in history.\nIn 2012, Doudna and Charpentier were first to publish a description of a CRISPR gene editor that could be programmed to precisely cut DNA in a test tube. There\u2019s no dispute about that.\nHowever, the patent fight relates to the use of CRISPR to edit inside animal cells\u2014like those of human beings. That\u2019s considered a distinct invention, and one both sides say they were first to come up with that very same year.\u00a0\nIn patent law, this moment is known as conception\u2014the instant a lightbulb appears over an inventor\u2019s head, revealing a definite and workable plan for how an invention is going to function.\nIn 2022, a specialized body called the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, decided that Doudna and Charpentier hadn\u2019t fully conceived the invention because they initially encountered trouble getting their editor to work in fish and other species. Indeed, they had so much trouble that Zhang scooped them with a 2013 publication demonstrating he could use CRISPR to edit human cells.\nThe Nobelists appealed the finding, and yesterday the appeals court vacated it, saying the patent board applied the wrong standard and needs to reconsider the case.\u00a0\nAccording to the court, Doudna and Charpentier didn\u2019t have to \u201cknow their invention would work\u201d to get credit for conceiving it. What could matter more, the court said, is that it actually did work in the end.\u00a0\nIn a statement, the University of California, Berkeley, applauded the call for a do-over.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision creates an opportunity for the PTAB to reevaluate the evidence under the correct legal standard and confirm what the rest of the world has recognized: that the Doudna and Charpentier team were the first to develop this groundbreaking technology for the world to share,\u201d Jeff Lamken, one of Berkeley\u2019s attorneys, said in the statement.\nThe Broad Institute posted a statement saying it is \u201cconfident\u201d the appeals board \u201cwill again confirm Broad\u2019s patents, because the underlying facts have not changed.\u201d\nThe decision is likely to reopen the investigation into what was written in 13-year-old lab notebooks and whether Zhang based his research, in part, on what he learned from Doudna and Charpentier\u2019s publications.\u00a0\nThe case will now return to the patent board for a further look, although Sherkow says the court finding can also be appealed directly to the US Supreme Court.\u00a0",

What could matter more, the court said, is that it actually did work in the end.\u00a0\nIn a statement, the University of California, Berkeley, applauded the call for a do-over.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision creates an opportunity for the PTAB to reevaluate the evidence under the correct legal standard and confirm what the rest of the world has recognized: that the Doudna and Charpentier team were the first to develop this groundbreaking technology for the world to share,\u201d Jeff Lamken, one of Berkeley\u2019s attorneys, said in the statement.\nThe Broad Institute posted a statement saying it is \u201cconfident\u201d the appeals board \u201cwill again confirm Broad\u2019s patents, because the underlying facts have not changed.\u201d\nThe decision is likely to reopen the investigation into what was written in 13-year-old lab notebooks and whether Zhang based his research, in part, on what he learned from Doudna and Charpentier\u2019s publications.\u00a0\nThe case will now return to the patent board for a further look, although Sherkow says the court finding can also be appealed directly to the US Supreme Court.\u00a0"

    "summary": "Police and federal agencies have found a controversial new way to skirt the growing patchwork of laws that curb how they use facial recognition: an AI model that can track people using attributes like body size, gender, hair color and style, clothing, and accessories.\u00a0\nThe tool, called Track and built by the video analytics company Veritone, is used by 400 customers, including state and local police departments and universities all over the US. It is also expanding federally: US attorneys at the Department of Justice began using Track for criminal investigations last August. Veritone\u2019s broader suite of AI tools, which includes bona fide facial recognition, is also used by the Department of Homeland Security\u2014which houses immigration agencies\u2014and the Department of Defense, according to the company.\u00a0\n\u201cThe whole vision behind Track in the first place,\u201d says Veritone CEO Ryan Steelberg, was \u201cif we\u2019re not allowed to track people\u2019s faces, how do we assist in trying to potentially identify criminals or malicious behavior or activity?\u201d In addition to tracking individuals where facial recognition isn\u2019t legally allowed, Steelberg says, it allows for tracking when faces are obscured or not visible.\u00a0\nThe product has drawn criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union, which\u2014after learning of the tool through MIT Technology Review\u2014said it was the first instance they\u2019d seen of a nonbiometric tracking system used at scale in the US. They warned that it raises many of the same privacy concerns as facial recognition but also introduces new ones at a time when the Trump administration is pushing federal agencies to ramp up monitoring of protesters, immigrants, and students.\nVeritone gave us a demonstration of Track in which it analyzed people in footage from different environments, ranging from the January 6 riots to subway stations. You can use it to find people by specifying body size, gender, hair color and style, shoes, clothing, and various accessories. The tool can then assemble timelines, tracking a person across different locations and video feeds. It can be accessed through Amazon and Microsoft cloud platforms.\nVERITONE; MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW (CAPTIONS)\n\nIn an interview, Steelberg said that the number of attributes Track uses to identify people will continue to grow. When asked if Track differentiates on the basis of skin tone, a company spokesperson said it\u2019s one of the attributes the algorithm uses to tell people apart but that the software does not currently allow users to search for people by skin color. Track currently operates only on recorded video, but Steelberg claims the company is less than a year from being able to run it on live video feeds.\nAgencies using Track can add footage from police body cameras, drones, public videos on YouTube, or so-called citizen upload footage (from Ring cameras or cell phones, for example) in response to police requests. \n\u201cWe like to call this our Jason Bourne app,\u201d Steelberg says. He expects the technology to come under scrutiny in court cases but says, \u201cI hope we\u2019re exonerating people as much as we\u2019re helping police find the bad guys.\u201d The public sector currently accounts for only 6% of Veritone\u2019s business (most of its clients are media and entertainment companies), but the company says that\u2019s its fastest-growing market, with clients in places including California, Washington, Colorado, New Jersey, and Illinois.\u00a0\nThat rapid expansion has started to cause alarm in certain quarters. Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU, wrote in 2019 that artificial intelligence would someday expedite the tedious task of combing through surveillance footage, enabling automated analysis regardless of whether a crime has occurred. Since then, lots of police-tech companies have been building video analytics systems that can, for example, detect when a person enters a certain area. However, Stanley says, Track is the first product he\u2019s seen make broad tracking of particular people technologically feasible at scale.\n\u201cThis is a potentially authoritarian technology,\u201d he says. \u201cOne that gives great powers to the police and the government that will make it easier for them, no doubt, to solve certain crimes, but will also make it easier for them to overuse this technology, and to potentially abuse it.\u201d\nChances of such abusive surveillance, Stanley says, are particularly high right now in the federal agencies where Veritone has customers. The Department of Homeland Security said last month that it will monitor the social media activities of immigrants and use evidence it finds there to deny visas and green cards, and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has detained activists following pro-Palestinian statements or appearances at protests.\u00a0\nIn an interview, Jon Gacek, general manager of Veritone\u2019s public-sector business, said that Track is a \u201cculling tool\u201d meant to speed up the task of identifying important parts of videos, not a general surveillance tool. Veritone did not specify which groups within the Department of Homeland Security or other federal agencies use Track.\u00a0The Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. \nFor police departments, the tool dramatically expands the amount of video that can be used in investigations. Whereas facial recognition requires footage in which faces are clearly visible, Track doesn\u2019t have that limitation. Nathan Wessler, an attorney for the ACLU, says this means police might comb through videos they had no interest in before.\u00a0\n\u201cIt creates a categorically new scale and nature of privacy invasion and potential for abuse that was literally not possible any time before in human history,\u201d Wessler says. \u201cYou\u2019re now talking about not speeding up what a cop could do, but creating a capability that no cop ever had before.\u201d\nTrack\u2019s expansion comes as laws limiting the use of facial recognition have spread, sparked by wrongful arrests in which officers have been overly confident in the judgments of algorithms.\u00a0 Numerous studies have shown that such algorithms are less accurate with nonwhite faces. Laws in Montana and Maine sharply limit when police can use it\u2014it\u2019s not allowed in real time with live video\u2014while San Francisco and Oakland, California have near-complete bans on facial recognition. Track provides an alternative.\u00a0\nThough such laws often reference \u201cbiometric data,\u201d Wessler says this phrase is far from clearly defined. It generally refers to immutable characteristics like faces, gait and fingerprints rather than things that change, like clothing. But certain attributes, such as body size, blur this distinction.\u00a0\nConsider also, Wessler says, someone in winter who frequently wears the same boots, coat, and backpack. \u201cTheir profile is going to be the same day after day,\u201d Wessler says. \u201cThe potential to track somebody over time based on how they\u2019re moving across a whole bunch of different saved video feeds is pretty equivalent to face recognition.\u201d\nIn other words, Track might provide a way of following someone that raises many of the same concerns as facial recognition, but isn\u2019t subject to laws restricting use of facial recognition because it does not technically involve biometric data. Steelberg said there are several ongoing cases that include video evidence from Track, but that he couldn\u2019t name the cases or comment further. So for now, it\u2019s unclear whether it\u2019s being adopted in jurisdictions where facial recognition is banned.\u00a0",

This scenario is the inspiration for a new AI headphone system that translates the speech of multiple speakers simultaneously, in real time.\nHow it works: The system tracks the direction and vocal characteristics of each speaker, helping the person wearing the headphones to identify who is saying what in a group setting. Read the full story.\n\u2014Rhiannon Williams\n\nYour gut microbes might encourage criminal behavior\nA few years ago, a Belgian man in his 30s drove into a lamppost. Twice. Local authorities found that his blood alcohol level was four times the legal limit. Over the space of a few years, the man was apprehended for drunk driving three times.

Last year, he was acquitted of drunk driving.\nHis case, along with several other scientific studies, raises a fascinating question for microbiology, neuroscience, and the law: How much of our behavior can we blame on our microbes?\nEach of us hosts vast communities of tiny bacteria, archaea (which are a bit like bacteria), fungi, and even viruses all over our bodies. The largest collection resides in our guts, which play home to trillions of them. You have more microbial cells than human cells in your body. In some ways, we\u2019re more microbe than human.\nMicrobiologists are still getting to grips with what all these microbes do. Some seem to help us break down food. Others produce chemicals that are important for our health in some way. But the picture is extremely complicated, partly because of the myriad ways microbes can interact with each other.\nBut they also interact with the human nervous system. Microbes can produce compounds that affect the way neurons work. They also influence the functioning of the immune system, which can have knock-on effects on the brain. And they seem to be able to communicate with the brain via the vagus nerve.\nIf microbes can influence our brains, could they also explain some of our behavior, including the criminal sort? Some microbiologists think so, at least in theory. \u201cMicrobes control us more than we think they do,\u201d says Emma Allen-Vercoe, a microbiologist at the University of Guelph in Canada.\nResearchers have come up with a name for applications of microbiology to criminal law: the legalome. A better understanding of how microbes influence our behavior could not only affect legal proceedings but also shape crime prevention and rehabilitation efforts, argue Susan Prescott, a pediatrician and immunologist at the University of Western Australia, and her colleagues.\n\u201cFor the person unaware that they have auto-brewery syndrome, we can argue that microbes are like a marionettist pulling the strings in what would otherwise be labeled as criminal behavior,\u201d says Prescott.\nAuto-brewery syndrome is a fairly straightforward example (it has been involved in the acquittal of at least two people so far), but other brain-microbe relationships are likely to be more complicated. We do know a little about one microbe that seems to influence behavior: Toxoplasmosis gondii, a parasite that reproduces in cats and spreads to other animals via cat feces.\nThe parasite is best known for changing the behavior of rodents in ways that make them easier prey\u2014an infection seems to make mice permanently lose their fear of cats. Research in humans is nowhere near conclusive, but some studies have linked infections with the parasite to personality changes, increased aggression, and impulsivity.\n\u201cThat\u2019s an example of microbiology that we know affects the brain and could potentially affect the legal standpoint of someone who\u2019s being tried for a crime,\u201d says Allen-Vercoe. \u201cThey might say \u2018My microbes made me do it,\u2019 and I might believe them.\u201d\nThere\u2019s more evidence linking gut microbes to behavior in mice, which are some of the most well-studied creatures. One study involved fecal transplants\u2014a procedure that involves inserting fecal matter from one animal into the intestines of another. Because feces contain so much gut bacteria, fecal transplants can go some way to swap out a gut microbiome. (Humans are doing this too\u2014and it seems to be a remarkably effective way to treat persistent C. difficile infections in people.)\nBack in 2013, scientists at McMaster University in Canada performed fecal transplants between two strains of mice, one that is known for being timid and another that tends to be rather gregarious. This swapping of gut microbes also seemed to swap their behavior\u2014the timid mice became more gregarious, and vice versa.\nMicrobiologists have since held up this study as one of the clearest demonstrations of how changing gut microbes can change behavior\u2014at least in mice. \u201cBut the question is: How much do they control you, and how much is the human part of you able to overcome that control?\u201d says Allen-Vercoe. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a really tough question to answer.\u201d\nAfter all, our gut microbiomes, though relatively stable, can change. Your diet, exercise routine, environment, and even the people you live with can shape the communities of microbes that live on and in you. And the ways these communities shift and influence behavior might be slightly different for everyone. Pinning down precise links between certain microbes and criminal behaviors will be extremely difficult, if not impossible.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be able to take someone\u2019s microbiome and say \u2018Oh, look\u2014you\u2019ve got bug X, and that means you\u2019re a serial killer,\u201d says Allen-Vercoe.\nEither way, Prescott hopes that advances in microbiology and metabolomics might help us better understand the links between microbes, the chemicals they produce, and criminal behaviors\u2014and potentially even treat those behaviors.\n\u201cWe could get to a place where microbial interventions are a part of therapeutic programming,\u201d she says.\nThis article first appeared in The Checkup,\u00a0MIT Technology Review\u2019s\u00a0weekly biotech newsletter.

    "summary": "Imagine going for dinner with a group of friends who switch in and out of different languages you don\u2019t speak, but still being able to understand what they\u2019re saying. This scenario is the inspiration for a new AI headphone system that translates the speech of multiple speakers simultaneously, in real time.\nThe system, called Spatial Speech Translation, tracks the direction and vocal characteristics of each speaker, helping the person wearing the headphones to identify who is saying what in a group setting.\u00a0\n\u201cThere are so many smart people across the world, and the language barrier prevents them from having the confidence to communicate,\u201d says Shyam Gollakota, a professor at the University of Washington, who worked on the project. \u201cMy mom has such incredible ideas when she\u2019s speaking in Telugu, but it\u2019s so hard for her to communicate with people in the US when she visits from India. We think this kind of system could be transformative for people like her.\u201d\nWhile there are plenty of other live AI translation systems out there, such as the one running on Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses, they focus on a single speaker, not multiple people speaking at once, and deliver robotic-sounding automated translations. The new system is designed to work with existing, off-the shelf noise-canceling headphones that have microphones, plugged into a laptop powered by Apple\u2019s M2 silicon chip, which can support neural networks. The same chip is also present in the Apple Vision Pro headset. The research was presented at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Yokohama, Japan, this month.\nOver the past few years, large language models have driven big improvements in speech translation. As a result, translation between languages for which lots of training data is available (such as the four languages used in this study) is close to perfect on apps like Google Translate or in ChatGPT. But it\u2019s still not seamless and instant across many languages. That\u2019s a goal a lot of companies are working toward, says Alina Karakanta, an assistant professor at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who studies computational linguistics and was not involved in the project. \u201cI feel that this is a useful application. It can help people,\u201d she says.\u00a0\nSpatial Speech Translation consists of two AI models, the first of which divides the space surrounding the person wearing the headphones into small regions and uses a neural network to search for potential speakers and pinpoint their direction.\u00a0\nThe second model then translates the speakers\u2019 words from French, German, or Spanish into English text using publicly available data sets. The same model extracts the unique characteristics and emotional tone of each speaker\u2019s voice, such as the pitch and the amplitude, and applies those properties to the text, essentially creating a \u201ccloned\u201d voice. This means that when the translated version of a speaker\u2019s words is relayed to the headphone wearer a few seconds later, it sounds as if it\u2019s coming from the speaker\u2019s direction and the voice sounds a lot like the speaker\u2019s own, not a robotic-sounding computer.\nGiven that separating out human voices is hard enough for AI systems, being able to incorporate that ability into a real-time translation system, map the distance between the wearer and the speaker, and achieve decent latency on a real device is impressive, says Samuele Cornell, a postdoc researcher at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Language Technologies Institute, who did not work on the project.\n\u201cReal-time speech-to-speech translation is incredibly hard,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir results are very good in the limited testing settings. But for a real product, one would need much more training data\u2014possibly with noise and real-world recordings from the headset, rather than purely relying on synthetic data.\u201d\nGollakota\u2019s team is now focusing on reducing the amount of time it takes for the AI translation to kick in after a speaker says something, which will accommodate more natural-sounding conversations between people speaking different languages. \u201cWe want to really get down that latency significantly to less than a second, so that you can still have the conversational vibe,\u201d Gollakota says.\nThis remains a major challenge, because the speed at which an AI system can translate one language into another depends on the languages\u2019 structure. Of the three languages Spatial Speech Translation was trained on, the system was quickest to translate French into English, followed by Spanish and then German\u2014reflecting how German, unlike the other languages, places a sentence\u2019s verbs and much of its meaning at the end and not at the beginning, says Claudio Fantinuoli, a researcher at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in Germany, who did not work on the project.\u00a0\nReducing the latency could make the translations less accurate, he warns: \u201cThe longer you wait [before translating], the more context you have, and the better the translation will be. It\u2019s a balancing act.\u201d",

This means that when the translated version of a speaker\u2019s words is relayed to the headphone wearer a few seconds later, it sounds as if it\u2019s coming from the speaker\u2019s direction and the voice sounds a lot like the speaker\u2019s own, not a robotic-sounding computer.\nGiven that separating out human voices is hard enough for AI systems, being able to incorporate that ability into a real-time translation system, map the distance between the wearer and the speaker, and achieve decent latency on a real device is impressive, says Samuele Cornell, a postdoc researcher at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Language Technologies Institute, who did not work on the project.\n\u201cReal-time speech-to-speech translation is incredibly hard,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir results are very good in the limited testing settings. But for a real product, one would need much more training data\u2014possibly with noise and real-world recordings from the headset, rather than purely relying on synthetic data.\u201d\nGollakota\u2019s team is now focusing on reducing the amount of time it takes for the AI translation to kick in after a speaker says something, which will accommodate more natural-sounding conversations between people speaking different languages. \u201cWe want to really get down that latency significantly to less than a second, so that you can still have the conversational vibe,\u201d Gollakota says.\nThis remains a major challenge, because the speed at which an AI system can translate one language into another depends on the languages\u2019 structure. Of the three languages Spatial Speech Translation was trained on, the system was quickest to translate French into English, followed by Spanish and then German\u2014reflecting how German, unlike the other languages, places a sentence\u2019s verbs and much of its meaning at the end and not at the beginning, says Claudio Fantinuoli, a researcher at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in Germany, who did not work on the project.\u00a0\nReducing the latency could make the translations less accurate, he warns: \u201cThe longer you wait [before translating], the more context you have, and the better the translation will be. It\u2019s a balancing act.\u201d"

And even as we wait for the bigger picture, there are a few takeaways that could help our future grid.\nLet\u2019s start with what we know so far about what happened, according to the Spanish grid operator Red El\u00e9ctrica:\n\nA disruption in electricity generation took place a little after 12:30 p.m. This may have been a power plant flipping off or some transmission equipment going down.\nA little over a second later, the grid lost another bit of generation.\nA few seconds after that, the main interconnector between Spain and southwestern France got disconnected as a result of grid instability.\nImmediately after, virtually all of Spain\u2019s electricity generation tripped offline.\n\nOne of the theories floating around is that things went wrong because the grid diverged from its normal frequency. (All power grids have a set frequency: In Europe the standard is 50 hertz, which means the current switches directions 50 times per second.) The frequency needs to be constant across the grid to keep things running smoothly.\nThere are signs that the outage could be frequency-related. Some experts pointed out that strange oscillations in the grid frequency occurred shortly before the blackout.\nNormally, our grid can handle small problems like an oscillation in frequency or a drop that comes from a power plant going offline. But some of the grid\u2019s ability to stabilize itself is tied up in old ways of generating electricity.\nPower plants like those that run on coal and natural gas have massive rotating generators. If there are brief issues on the grid that upset the balance, those physical bits of equipment have inertia: They\u2019ll keep moving at least for a few seconds, providing some time for other power sources to respond and pick up the slack.

The order matters, for example. During that drop in generation, did wind and solar plants go offline first? Or did everything go down together?\nWhether or not solar and wind contributed to the blackout as a root cause, we do know that wind and solar don\u2019t contribute to grid stability in the same way that some other power sources do, says Seaver Wang, climate lead of the Breakthrough Institute, an environmental research organization. Regardless of whether renewables are to blame, more capability to stabilize the grid would only help, he adds.\nIt\u2019s not that a renewable-heavy grid is doomed to fail.

Reversing a plan to shut down Spain\u2019s nuclear reactors beginning in 2027 would be helpful, Wang says.
