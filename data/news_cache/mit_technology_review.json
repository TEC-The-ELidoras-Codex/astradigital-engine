    "summary": "Google DeepMind has once again used large language models to discover new solutions to long-standing problems in math and computer science. This time the firm has shown that its approach can not only tackle unsolved theoretical puzzles, but improve a range of important real-world processes as well.\nGoogle DeepMind\u2019s new tool, called AlphaEvolve, uses the Gemini 2.0 family of large language models (LLMs) to produce code for a wide range of different tasks. LLMs are known to be hit and miss at coding. The twist here is that AlphaEvolve scores each of Gemini\u2019s suggestions, throwing out the bad and tweaking the good, in an iterative process, until it has produced the best algorithm it can. In many cases, the results are more efficient or more accurate than the best existing (human-written) solutions.\n\u201cYou can see it as a sort of super coding agent,\u201d says Pushmeet Kohli, a vice president at Google DeepMind who leads its AI for Science teams. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just propose a piece of code or an edit, it actually produces a result that maybe nobody was aware of.\u201d\nIn particular, AlphaEvolve came up with a way to improve the software Google uses to allocate jobs to its many millions of servers around the world. Google DeepMind claims the company has been using this new software across all of its data centers for more than a year, freeing up 0.7% of Google\u2019s total computing resources. That might not sound like much, but at Google\u2019s scale it\u2019s huge.\nJakob Moosbauer, a mathematician at the University of Warwick in the UK, is impressed. He says the way AlphaEvolve searches for algorithms that produce specific solutions\u2014rather than searching for the solutions themselves\u2014makes it especially powerful. \u201cIt makes the approach applicable to such a wide range of problems,\u201d he says. \u201cAI is becoming a tool that will be essential in mathematics and computer science.\u201d\nAlphaEvolve continues a line of work that Google DeepMind has been pursuing for years. Its vision is that AI can help to advance human knowledge across math and science. In 2022, it developed AlphaTensor, a model that found a faster way to solve matrix multiplications\u2014a fundamental problem in computer science\u2014beating a record that had stood for more than 50 years. In 2023, it revealed AlphaDev, which discovered faster ways to perform a number of basic calculations performed by computers trillions of times a day. AlphaTensor and AlphaDev both turn math problems into a kind of game, then search for a winning series of moves.\nFunSearch, which arrived in late 2023, swapped out game-playing AI and replaced it with LLMs that can generate code. Because LLMs can carry out a range of tasks, FunSearch can take on a wider variety of problems than its predecessors, which were trained to play just one type of game. The tool was used to crack a famous unsolved problem in pure mathematics.\nAlphaEvolve is the next generation of FunSearch. Instead of coming up with short snippets of code to solve a specific problem, as FunSearch did, it can produce programs that are hundreds of lines long. This makes it applicable to a much wider variety of problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn theory, AlphaEvolve could be applied to any problem that can be described in code and that has solutions that can be evaluated by a computer. \u201cAlgorithms run the world around us, so the impact of that is huge,\u201d says Matej Balog, a researcher at Google DeepMind who leads the algorithm discovery team.\nSurvival of the fittest\nHere\u2019s how it works: AlphaEvolve can be prompted like any LLM. Give it a description of the problem and any extra hints you want, such as previous solutions, and AlphaEvolve will get Gemini 2.0 Flash (the smallest, fastest version of Google DeepMind\u2019s flagship LLM) to generate multiple blocks of code to solve the problem.\nIt then takes these candidate solutions, runs them to see how accurate or efficient they are, and scores them according to a range of relevant metrics. Does this code produce the correct result? Does it run faster than previous solutions? And so on.\nAlphaEvolve then takes the best of the current batch of solutions and asks Gemini to improve them. Sometimes AlphaEvolve will throw a previous solution back into the mix to prevent Gemini from hitting a dead end.\nWhen it gets stuck, AlphaEvolve can also call on Gemini 2.0 Pro, the most powerful of Google DeepMind\u2019s LLMs. The idea is to generate many solutions with the faster Flash but add solutions from the slower Pro when needed.\nThese rounds of generation, scoring, and regeneration continue until Gemini fails to come up with anything better than what it already has.\nNumber games\nThe team tested AlphaEvolve on a range of different problems. For example, they looked at matrix multiplication again to see how a general-purpose tool like AlphaEvolve compared to the specialized AlphaTensor. Matrices are grids of numbers. Matrix multiplication is a basic computation that underpins many applications, from AI to computer graphics, yet nobody knows the fastest way to do it. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of unbelievable that it\u2019s still an open question,\u201d says Balog.\nThe team gave AlphaEvolve a description of the problem and an example of a standard algorithm for solving it. The tool not only produced new algorithms that could calculate 14 different sizes of matrix faster than any existing approach, it also improved on AlphaTensor\u2019s record-beating result for multipying two four-by-four matrices. \nAlphaEvolve scored 16,000 candidates suggested by Gemini to find the winning solution, but that\u2019s still more efficient than AlphaTensor, says Balog. AlphaTensor\u2019s solution also only worked when a matrix was filled with 0s and 1s. AlphaEvolve solves the problem with other numbers too.\n\u201cThe result on matrix multiplication is very impressive,\u201d says Moosbauer. \u201cThis new algorithm has the potential to speed up computations in practice.\u201d\nManuel Kauers, a mathematician at Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria, agrees: \u201cThe improvement for matrices is likely to have practical relevance.\u201d\nBy coincidence, Kauers and a colleague have just used a different computational technique to find some of the speedups AlphaEvolve came up with. The pair posted a paper online reporting their results last week.\n\u201cIt is great to see that we are moving forward with the understanding of matrix multiplication,\u201d says Kauers. \u201cEvery technique that helps is a welcome contribution to this effort.\u201d\nReal-world problems\nMatrix multiplication was just one breakthrough. In total, Google DeepMind tested AlphaEvolve on more than 50 different types of well-known math puzzles, including problems in Fourier analysis (the math behind data compression, essential to applications such as video streaming), the minimum overlap problem (an open problem in number theory proposed by mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s in 1955), and kissing numbers (a problem introduced by Isaac Newton that has applications in materials science, chemistry, and cryptography). AlphaEvolve matched the best existing solutions in 75% of cases and found better solutions in 20% of cases.\u00a0\u00a0\nGoogle DeepMind then applied AlphaEvolve to a handful of real-world problems. As well as coming up with a more efficient algorithm for managing computational resources across data centers, the tool found a way to reduce the power consumption of Google\u2019s specialized tensor processing unit chips.\nAlphaEvolve even found a way to speed up the training of Gemini itself, by producing a more efficient algorithm for managing a certain type of computation used in the training process.\nGoogle DeepMind plans to continue exploring potential applications of its tool. One limitation is that AlphaEvolve can\u2019t be used for problems with solutions that need to be scored by a person, such as lab experiments that are subject to interpretation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMoosbauer also points out that while AlphaEvolve may produce impressive new results across a wide range of problems, it gives little theoretical insight into how it arrived at those solutions. That\u2019s a drawback when it comes to advancing human understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\nEven so, tools like AlphaEvolve are set to change the way researchers work. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are finished,\u201d says Kohli. \u201cThere is much further that we can go in terms of how powerful this type of approach is.\u201d",

    "summary": "A bill that allows medical clinics to sell unproven treatments has been passed in Montana.\u00a0\nUnder the legislation, doctors can apply for a license to open an experimental treatment clinic and recommend and sell therapies not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to their patients. Once it\u2019s signed by the governor, the law will be the most expansive in the country in allowing access to drugs that have not been fully tested.\u00a0\nThe bill allows for any drug produced in the state to be sold in it, providing it has been through phase I clinical trials\u2014the initial, generally small, first-in-human studies that are designed to check that a new treatment is not harmful. These trials do not determine if the drug is effective.\nThe bill, which was passed by the state legislature on April 29 and is expected to be signed by Governor Greg Gianforte, essentially expands on existing Right to Try legislation in the state. But while that law was originally designed to allow terminally ill people to access experimental drugs, the new bill was drafted and lobbied for by people interested in extending human lifespans\u2014a group of longevity enthusiasts that includes scientists, libertarians, and influencers.\u00a0\u00a0\nThese longevity enthusiasts are hoping Montana will serve as a test bed for opening up access to experimental drugs. \u201cI see no reason why it couldn\u2019t be adopted by most of the other states,\u201d said Todd White, speaking to an audience of policymakers and others interested in longevity at an event late last month in Washington, DC. White, who helped develop the bill and directs a research organization focused on aging, added that \u201cthere are some things that can be done at the federal level to allow Right to Try laws to proliferate more readily.\u201d\u00a0\nSupporters of the bill say it gives individuals the freedom to make choices about their own bodies. At the same event, bioethicist Jessica Flanigan of the University of Richmond said she was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the measure, because \u201cit\u2019s great any time anybody is trying to give people back their medical autonomy.\u201d\u00a0\nUltimately, they hope that the new law will enable people to try unproven drugs that might help them live longer, make it easier for Americans to try experimental treatments without having to travel abroad, and potentially turn Montana into a medical tourism hub.\nBut ethicists and legal scholars aren\u2019t as optimistic. \u201cI hate it,\u201d bioethicist Alison Bateman-House of New York University says of the bill. She and others are worried about the ethics of promoting and selling unproven treatments\u2014and the risks of harm should something go wrong.\nEasy access?\nNo drugs have been approved to treat human aging. Some in the longevity field believe that regulation has held back the development of such drugs. In the US, federal law requires that drugs be shown to be both safe and effective before they can be sold. That requirement was made law in the 1960s following the thalidomide tragedy, in which women who took the drug for morning sickness had babies with sometimes severe disabilities. Since then, the FDA has been responsible for the approval of new drugs.\u00a0\u00a0\nTypically, new drugs are put through a series of human trials. Phase I trials generally involve between 20 and 100 volunteers and are designed to check that the drug is safe for humans. If it is, the drug is then tested in larger groups of hundreds, and then thousands, of volunteers to assess the dose and whether it actually works. Once a drug is approved, people who are prescribed it are monitored for side effects. The entire process is slow, and it can last more than a decade\u2014a particular pain point for people who are acutely aware of their own aging.\u00a0\nBut some exceptions have been made for people who are terminally ill under Right to Try laws. Those laws allow certain individuals to apply for access to experimental treatments that have been through phase I clinical trials but have not received FDA approval.\nMontana first passed a Right to Try law in 2015 (a federal law was passed around three years later). Then in 2023, the state expanded the law to include all patients there, not just those with terminal illnesses\u2014meaning that any person in Montana could, in theory, take a drug that had been through only a phase I trial.\nAt the time, this was cheered by many longevity enthusiasts\u2014some of whom had helped craft the expanded measure.\nBut practically, the change hasn\u2019t worked out as they envisioned. \u201cThere was no licensing, no processing, no registration\u201d for clinics that might want to offer those drugs, says White. \u201cThere needed to be another bill that provided regulatory clarity for service providers.\u201d\u00a0\nSo the new legislation addresses \u201chow clinics can set up shop in Montana,\u201d says Dylan Livingston, founder and CEO of the Alliance for Longevity Initiatives, which hosted the DC event. Livingston built A4LI, as it\u2019s known, a few years ago, as a lobbying group for the science of human aging and longevity.\nLivingston, who is exploring multiple approaches to improve both funding for scientific research and to change drug regulation, helped develop and push the 2023 bill in Montana with the support of State Senator Kenneth Bogner, he says. \u201cI gave [Bogner] a menu of things that could be done at the state level \u2026 and he loved the idea\u201d of turning Montana into a medical tourism hub, he says.\u00a0\nAfter all, as things stand, plenty of Americans travel abroad to receive experimental treatments that cannot legally be sold in the US, including expensive, unproven stem cell and gene therapies, says Livingston.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to go and get an experimental gene therapy, you might as well keep it in the country,\u201d he says. Livingston has suggested that others might be interested in trying a novel drug designed to clear aged \u201csenescent\u201d cells from the body, which is currently entering phase II trials for an eye condition caused by diabetes. \u201cOne: let\u2019s keep the money in the country, and two: if I was a millionaire getting an experimental gene therapy, I\u2019d rather be in Montana than Honduras.\u201d\n\u201cLos Alamos for longevity\u201d\nHonduras, in particular, has become something of a home base for longevity experiments. The island of Roat\u00e1n is home to the Global Alliance for Regenerative Medicine clinic, which, along with various stem cell products, sells a controversial unproven \u201canti-aging\u201d gene therapy for around $20,000 to customers including wealthy longevity influencer Bryan Johnson.\u00a0\nTech entrepreneur and longevity enthusiast Niklas Anzinger has also founded the city of Infinita in the region\u2019s special economic zone of Pr\u00f3spera, a private city where residents are able to make their own suggestions for medical regulations. It\u2019s the second time he\u2019s built a community there as part of his effort to build a \u201cLos Alamos for longevity\u201d on the island, a place where biotech companies can develop therapies that slow or reverse human aging \u201cat warp speed,\u201d and where individuals are free to take those experimental treatments. (The first community, Vitalia, featured a biohacking lab, but came to an end following a disagreement between the two founders.)\u00a0\nAnzinger collaborated with White, the longevity enthusiast who spoke at the A4LI event (and is an advisor to Infinita VC, Anzinger\u2019s investment company), to help put together the new Montana bill. \u201cHe asked if I would help him try to advance the new bill, so that\u2019s what we did for the last few months,\u201d says White, who trained as an electrical engineer but left his career in telecommunications to work with an organization that uses blockchain to fund research into extending human lifespans.\u00a0\n\u201cRight to Try has always been this thing [for people] who are terminal[ly ill] and trying a Hail Mary approach to solving these things; now Right to Try laws are being used to allow you to access treatments earlier,\u201d White told the audience at the A4LI event. \u201cMaking it so that people can use longevity medicines earlier is, I think, a very important thing.\u201d\nThe new bill largely sets out the \u201cinfrastructure\u201d for clinics that want to sell experimental treatments, says White. It states that clinics will need to have a license, for example, and that this must be renewed on an annual basis.\u00a0\n\u201cNow somebody who actually wants to deliver drugs under the Right to Try law will be able to do so,\u201d he says. The new legislation also protects prescribing doctors from disciplinary action.\nAnd it sets out requirements for informed consent that go further than those of existing Right to Try laws. Before a person takes an experimental drug under the new law, they will be required to provide a written consent that includes a list of approved alternative drugs and a description of the worst potential outcome.\nOn the safe side\n\u201cIn the Montana law, we explicitly enhanced the requirements for informed consent,\u201d Anzinger told an audience at the same A4LI event. This, along with the fact that the treatments will have been through phase I clinical trials, will help to keep people safe, he argued. \u201cWe have to treat this with a very large degree of responsibility,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe obviously don\u2019t want to be killing people,\u201d says Livingston.\u00a0\nBut he also adds that he, personally, won\u2019t be signing up for any experimental treatments. \u201cI want to be the 10 millionth, or even the 50 millionth, person to get the gene therapy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not that adventurous \u2026 I\u2019ll let other people go first.\u201d\nOthers are indeed concerned that, for the \u201cadventurous\u201d people, these experimental treatments won\u2019t necessarily be safe. Phase I trials are typically tiny, and they often involve less than 50 people, all of whom are typically in good health. A trial like that won\u2019t tell you much about side effects that only show up in 5% of people, for example, or about interactions the drug might have with other medicines.\nAround 90% of drug candidates in clinical trials fail. And around 17% of drugs fail late-stage clinical trials because of safety concerns. Even those that make it all the way through clinical trials and get approved by the FDA can still end up being withdrawn from the market when rare but serious side effects show up. Between 1992 and 2023, 23 drugs that were given accelerated approval for cancer indications were later withdrawn from the market. And between 1950 and 2013, the reason for the withdrawal of 95 drugs was \u201cdeath.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s disturbing that they want to make drugs available after phase I testing,\u201d says Sharona Hoffman, professor of law and bioethics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. \u201cThis could endanger patients.\u201d\n\u201cFamously, the doctor\u2019s first obligation is to first do no harm,\u201d says Bateman-House. \u201cIf [a drug] has not been through clinical trials, how do you have any standing on which to think it isn\u2019t going to do any harm?\u201d\nBut supporters of the bill argue that individuals can make their own decisions about risk. When speaking at the A4LI event, Flanigan introduced herself as a bioethicist before adding \u201cbut don\u2019t hold it against me; we\u2019re not all so bad.\u201d She argued that current drug regulations impose a \u201cmassive amount of restrictions on your bodily rights and your medical freedom.\u201d Why should public officials be the ones making decisions about what\u2019s safe for people? Individuals, she argued, should be empowered to make those judgments themselves.\nOther ethicists counter that this isn\u2019t an issue of people\u2019s rights. There are lots of generally accepted laws about when we can access drugs, says Hoffman; people aren\u2019t allowed to drink and drive because they might kill someone. \u201cSo, no, you don\u2019t have a right to ingest everything you want if there are risks associated with it.\u201d\nThe idea that individuals have a right to access experimental treatments has in fact failed in US courts in the past, says Carl Coleman, a bioethicist and legal scholar at Seton Hall in New Jersey.\u00a0\nHe points to a case from 20 years ago: In the early 2000s, Frank Burroughs founded the Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs. His daughter, Abigail Burroughs, had head and neck cancer, and she had tried and failed to access experimental drugs. In 2003, about two years after Abigail\u2019s death, the group sued the FDA, arguing that people with terminal cancer have a constitutionally protected right to access experimental, unapproved treatments, once those treatments have been through phase I trials. In 2007, however, a court rejected that argument, determining\u00a0 that terminally ill individuals do not have a constitutional right to experimental drugs.\nBateman-House also questions a provision in the Montana bill that claims to make treatments more equitable. It states that \u201cexperimental treatment centers\u201d should allocate 2% of their net annual profits \u201cto support access to experimental treatments and healthcare for qualifying Montana residents.\u201d Bateman-House says she\u2019s never seen that kind of language in a bill before. It may sound positive, but it could in practice introduce even more risk to the local community. \u201cOn the one hand, I like equity,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the other hand, I don\u2019t like equity to snake oil.\u201d\nAfter all, the doctors prescribing these drugs won\u2019t know if they will work. It is never ethical to make somebody pay for a treatment when you don\u2019t have any idea whether it will work, Bateman-House adds. \u201cThat\u2019s how the US system has been structured: There\u2019s no profit without evidence of safety and efficacy.\u201d\nThe clinics are coming\nAny clinics that offer experimental treatments in Montana will only be allowed to sell drugs that have been made within the state, says Coleman. \u201cFederal law requires any drug that is going to be distributed in interstate commerce to have FDA approval,\u201d he says.\nWhite isn\u2019t too worried about that. Montana already has manufacturing facilities for biotech and pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer. \u201cThat was one of the specific advantages [of focusing] on Montana, because everything can be done in state,\u201d he says.

(FDA commissioner Marty Makary has been a vocal critic of the agency and the pace at which it approves new drugs.)\nAt any rate, the clinics are coming to Montana, says Livingston. \u201cWe have half a dozen that are interested, and maybe two or three that are definitively going to set up shop out there.\u201d He won\u2019t name names, but he says some of the interested clinicians already have clinics in the US, while others are abroad.\u00a0\nMac Davis\u2014founder and CEO of Minicircle, the company that developed the controversial \u201canti-aging\u201d gene therapy\u2014told MIT Technology Review he was \u201clooking into it.\u201d\n\u201cI think this can be an opportunity for America and Montana to really kind of corner the market when it comes to medical tourism,\u201d says Livingston. \u201cThere is no other place in the world with this sort of regulatory environment.\u201d",
    "content": "A bill that allows medical clinics to sell unproven treatments has been passed in Montana.\u00a0\nUnder the legislation, doctors can apply for a license to open an experimental treatment clinic and recommend and sell therapies not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to their patients. Once it\u2019s signed by the governor, the law will be the most expansive in the country in allowing access to drugs that have not been fully tested.\u00a0\nThe bill allows for any drug produced in the state to be sold in it, providing it has been through phase I clinical trials\u2014the initial, generally small, first-in-human studies that are designed to check that a new treatment is not harmful. These trials do not determine if the drug is effective.\nThe bill, which was passed by the state legislature on April 29 and is expected to be signed by Governor Greg Gianforte, essentially expands on existing Right to Try legislation in the state. But while that law was originally designed to allow terminally ill people to access experimental drugs, the new bill was drafted and lobbied for by people interested in extending human lifespans\u2014a group of longevity enthusiasts that includes scientists, libertarians, and influencers.\u00a0\u00a0\nThese longevity enthusiasts are hoping Montana will serve as a test bed for opening up access to experimental drugs. \u201cI see no reason why it couldn\u2019t be adopted by most of the other states,\u201d said Todd White, speaking to an audience of policymakers and others interested in longevity at an event late last month in Washington, DC. White, who helped develop the bill and directs a research organization focused on aging, added that \u201cthere are some things that can be done at the federal level to allow Right to Try laws to proliferate more readily.\u201d\u00a0\nSupporters of the bill say it gives individuals the freedom to make choices about their own bodies. At the same event, bioethicist Jessica Flanigan of the University of Richmond said she was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the measure, because \u201cit\u2019s great any time anybody is trying to give people back their medical autonomy.\u201d\u00a0\nUltimately, they hope that the new law will enable people to try unproven drugs that might help them live longer, make it easier for Americans to try experimental treatments without having to travel abroad, and potentially turn Montana into a medical tourism hub.\nBut ethicists and legal scholars aren\u2019t as optimistic. \u201cI hate it,\u201d bioethicist Alison Bateman-House of New York University says of the bill. She and others are worried about the ethics of promoting and selling unproven treatments\u2014and the risks of harm should something go wrong.\nEasy access?\nNo drugs have been approved to treat human aging. Some in the longevity field believe that regulation has held back the development of such drugs. In the US, federal law requires that drugs be shown to be both safe and effective before they can be sold. That requirement was made law in the 1960s following the thalidomide tragedy, in which women who took the drug for morning sickness had babies with sometimes severe disabilities. Since then, the FDA has been responsible for the approval of new drugs.\u00a0\u00a0\nTypically, new drugs are put through a series of human trials. Phase I trials generally involve between 20 and 100 volunteers and are designed to check that the drug is safe for humans. If it is, the drug is then tested in larger groups of hundreds, and then thousands, of volunteers to assess the dose and whether it actually works. Once a drug is approved, people who are prescribed it are monitored for side effects. The entire process is slow, and it can last more than a decade\u2014a particular pain point for people who are acutely aware of their own aging.\u00a0\nBut some exceptions have been made for people who are terminally ill under Right to Try laws. Those laws allow certain individuals to apply for access to experimental treatments that have been through phase I clinical trials but have not received FDA approval.\nMontana first passed a Right to Try law in 2015 (a federal law was passed around three years later). Then in 2023, the state expanded the law to include all patients there, not just those with terminal illnesses\u2014meaning that any person in Montana could, in theory, take a drug that had been through only a phase I trial.\nAt the time, this was cheered by many longevity enthusiasts\u2014some of whom had helped craft the expanded measure.\nBut practically, the change hasn\u2019t worked out as they envisioned. \u201cThere was no licensing, no processing, no registration\u201d for clinics that might want to offer those drugs, says White. \u201cThere needed to be another bill that provided regulatory clarity for service providers.\u201d\u00a0\nSo the new legislation addresses \u201chow clinics can set up shop in Montana,\u201d says Dylan Livingston, founder and CEO of the Alliance for Longevity Initiatives, which hosted the DC event. Livingston built A4LI, as it\u2019s known, a few years ago, as a lobbying group for the science of human aging and longevity.\nLivingston, who is exploring multiple approaches to improve both funding for scientific research and to change drug regulation, helped develop and push the 2023 bill in Montana with the support of State Senator Kenneth Bogner, he says. \u201cI gave [Bogner] a menu of things that could be done at the state level \u2026 and he loved the idea\u201d of turning Montana into a medical tourism hub, he says.\u00a0\nAfter all, as things stand, plenty of Americans travel abroad to receive experimental treatments that cannot legally be sold in the US, including expensive, unproven stem cell and gene therapies, says Livingston.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to go and get an experimental gene therapy, you might as well keep it in the country,\u201d he says. Livingston has suggested that others might be interested in trying a novel drug designed to clear aged \u201csenescent\u201d cells from the body, which is currently entering phase II trials for an eye condition caused by diabetes. \u201cOne: let\u2019s keep the money in the country, and two: if I was a millionaire getting an experimental gene therapy, I\u2019d rather be in Montana than Honduras.\u201d\n\u201cLos Alamos for longevity\u201d\nHonduras, in particular, has become something of a home base for longevity experiments. The island of Roat\u00e1n is home to the Global Alliance for Regenerative Medicine clinic, which, along with various stem cell products, sells a controversial unproven \u201canti-aging\u201d gene therapy for around $20,000 to customers including wealthy longevity influencer Bryan Johnson.\u00a0\nTech entrepreneur and longevity enthusiast Niklas Anzinger has also founded the city of Infinita in the region\u2019s special economic zone of Pr\u00f3spera, a private city where residents are able to make their own suggestions for medical regulations. It\u2019s the second time he\u2019s built a community there as part of his effort to build a \u201cLos Alamos for longevity\u201d on the island, a place where biotech companies can develop therapies that slow or reverse human aging \u201cat warp speed,\u201d and where individuals are free to take those experimental treatments. (The first community, Vitalia, featured a biohacking lab, but came to an end following a disagreement between the two founders.)\u00a0\nAnzinger collaborated with White, the longevity enthusiast who spoke at the A4LI event (and is an advisor to Infinita VC, Anzinger\u2019s investment company), to help put together the new Montana bill. \u201cHe asked if I would help him try to advance the new bill, so that\u2019s what we did for the last few months,\u201d says White, who trained as an electrical engineer but left his career in telecommunications to work with an organization that uses blockchain to fund research into extending human lifespans.\u00a0\n\u201cRight to Try has always been this thing [for people] who are terminal[ly ill] and trying a Hail Mary approach to solving these things; now Right to Try laws are being used to allow you to access treatments earlier,\u201d White told the audience at the A4LI event. \u201cMaking it so that people can use longevity medicines earlier is, I think, a very important thing.\u201d\nThe new bill largely sets out the \u201cinfrastructure\u201d for clinics that want to sell experimental treatments, says White. It states that clinics will need to have a license, for example, and that this must be renewed on an annual basis.\u00a0\n\u201cNow somebody who actually wants to deliver drugs under the Right to Try law will be able to do so,\u201d he says. The new legislation also protects prescribing doctors from disciplinary action.\nAnd it sets out requirements for informed consent that go further than those of existing Right to Try laws. Before a person takes an experimental drug under the new law, they will be required to provide a written consent that includes a list of approved alternative drugs and a description of the worst potential outcome.\nOn the safe side\n\u201cIn the Montana law, we explicitly enhanced the requirements for informed consent,\u201d Anzinger told an audience at the same A4LI event. This, along with the fact that the treatments will have been through phase I clinical trials, will help to keep people safe, he argued. \u201cWe have to treat this with a very large degree of responsibility,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe obviously don\u2019t want to be killing people,\u201d says Livingston.\u00a0\nBut he also adds that he, personally, won\u2019t be signing up for any experimental treatments. \u201cI want to be the 10 millionth, or even the 50 millionth, person to get the gene therapy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not that adventurous \u2026 I\u2019ll let other people go first.\u201d\nOthers are indeed concerned that, for the \u201cadventurous\u201d people, these experimental treatments won\u2019t necessarily be safe. Phase I trials are typically tiny, and they often involve less than 50 people, all of whom are typically in good health. A trial like that won\u2019t tell you much about side effects that only show up in 5% of people, for example, or about interactions the drug might have with other medicines.\nAround 90% of drug candidates in clinical trials fail. And around 17% of drugs fail late-stage clinical trials because of safety concerns. Even those that make it all the way through clinical trials and get approved by the FDA can still end up being withdrawn from the market when rare but serious side effects show up. Between 1992 and 2023, 23 drugs that were given accelerated approval for cancer indications were later withdrawn from the market. And between 1950 and 2013, the reason for the withdrawal of 95 drugs was \u201cdeath.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s disturbing that they want to make drugs available after phase I testing,\u201d says Sharona Hoffman, professor of law and bioethics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. \u201cThis could endanger patients.\u201d\n\u201cFamously, the doctor\u2019s first obligation is to first do no harm,\u201d says Bateman-House. \u201cIf [a drug] has not been through clinical trials, how do you have any standing on which to think it isn\u2019t going to do any harm?\u201d\nBut supporters of the bill argue that individuals can make their own decisions about risk. When speaking at the A4LI event, Flanigan introduced herself as a bioethicist before adding \u201cbut don\u2019t hold it against me; we\u2019re not all so bad.\u201d She argued that current drug regulations impose a \u201cmassive amount of restrictions on your bodily rights and your medical freedom.\u201d Why should public officials be the ones making decisions about what\u2019s safe for people? Individuals, she argued, should be empowered to make those judgments themselves.\nOther ethicists counter that this isn\u2019t an issue of people\u2019s rights. There are lots of generally accepted laws about when we can access drugs, says Hoffman; people aren\u2019t allowed to drink and drive because they might kill someone. \u201cSo, no, you don\u2019t have a right to ingest everything you want if there are risks associated with it.\u201d\nThe idea that individuals have a right to access experimental treatments has in fact failed in US courts in the past, says Carl Coleman, a bioethicist and legal scholar at Seton Hall in New Jersey.\u00a0\nHe points to a case from 20 years ago: In the early 2000s, Frank Burroughs founded the Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs. His daughter, Abigail Burroughs, had head and neck cancer, and she had tried and failed to access experimental drugs. In 2003, about two years after Abigail\u2019s death, the group sued the FDA, arguing that people with terminal cancer have a constitutionally protected right to access experimental, unapproved treatments, once those treatments have been through phase I trials. In 2007, however, a court rejected that argument, determining\u00a0 that terminally ill individuals do not have a constitutional right to experimental drugs.\nBateman-House also questions a provision in the Montana bill that claims to make treatments more equitable. It states that \u201cexperimental treatment centers\u201d should allocate 2% of their net annual profits \u201cto support access to experimental treatments and healthcare for qualifying Montana residents.\u201d Bateman-House says she\u2019s never seen that kind of language in a bill before. It may sound positive, but it could in practice introduce even more risk to the local community. \u201cOn the one hand, I like equity,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the other hand, I don\u2019t like equity to snake oil.\u201d\nAfter all, the doctors prescribing these drugs won\u2019t know if they will work. It is never ethical to make somebody pay for a treatment when you don\u2019t have any idea whether it will work, Bateman-House adds. \u201cThat\u2019s how the US system has been structured: There\u2019s no profit without evidence of safety and efficacy.\u201d\nThe clinics are coming\nAny clinics that offer experimental treatments in Montana will only be allowed to sell drugs that have been made within the state, says Coleman. \u201cFederal law requires any drug that is going to be distributed in interstate commerce to have FDA approval,\u201d he says.\nWhite isn\u2019t too worried about that.

They were equipped with an experimental infrared device that can take readings as it\u2019s lowered down a hole in the snow to the ground.\nThe Sierra\u2019s frozen reservoir provides about a third of California\u2019s water and most of what comes out of the faucets, shower heads, and sprinklers in the towns and cities of northwestern Nevada. As it melts through the spring and summer, dam operators, water agencies, and communities have to manage the flow of billions of gallons of runoff, storing up enough to get through the inevitable dry summer months without allowing reservoirs and canals to flood.\nThe need for better snowpack temperature data has become increasingly critical for predicting when the water will flow down the mountains, as climate change fuels hotter weather, melts snow faster, and drives rapid swings between very wet and very dry periods.\u00a0\nIn the past, it has been arduous work to gather such snowpack observations. Now, a new generation of tools, techniques, and models promises to ease that process, improve water forecasts, and help California and other states safely manage one of their largest sources of water in the face of increasingly severe droughts and flooding.Observers, however, fear that any such advances could be undercut by the Trump administration\u2019s cutbacks across federal agencies, including the one that oversees federal snowpack monitoring and survey work. That could jeopardize ongoing efforts to produce the water data and forecasts on which Western communities rely.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have those measurements, it\u2019s like driving your car around without a fuel gauge,\u201d says Larry O\u2019Neill, Oregon\u2019s state climatologist. \u201cWe won\u2019t know how much water is up in the mountains, and whether there\u2019s enough to last through the summer.\u201d\nThe birth of snow surveys\nThe snow survey program in the US was born near Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America, around the turn of the 20th century.\u00a0\nWithout any reliable way of knowing how much water would flow down the mountain each spring, lakefront home and business owners, fearing floods, implored dam operators to release water early in the spring. Downstream communities and farmers pushed back, however, demanding that the dam was used to hold onto as much water as possible to avoid shortages later in the year.\u00a0\nIn 1908, James Church, a classics professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, whose passion for hiking around the mountains sparked an interest in the science of snow, invented a device that helped resolve the so-called Lake Tahoe Water Wars: the Mt. Rose snow sampler, named after the peak of a Sierra spur that juts into Nevada.\n\nJames Church, a professor of classics at the University of Nevada, Reno, became a pioneer in the field of snow surveys.COURTESY OF UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, RENO\n\n\nIt\u2019s a simple enough device, with sections of tube that screw together, a sharpened end, and measurement ticks along the side. Snow surveyors measure the depth of the snow by plunging the sampler down to the ground. They then weigh the filled tube on a specialized scale to calculate the water content of the snow.\u00a0\nChurch used the device to take measurements at various points across the range, and calibrated his water forecasts by comparing his readings against the rising and falling levels of Lake Tahoe.\u00a0\nIt worked so well that the US began a federal snow survey program in the mid-1930s, which evolved into the one carried on today by the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Throughout the winter, hundreds of snow surveyors across the American West head up to established locations on snowshoes, backcountry skis, or snowmobiles to deploy their Mt. Rose samplers, which have barely changed over more than a century.\u00a0\nIn the 1960s, the US government also began setting up a network of permanent monitoring sites across the mountains, now known as the SNOTEL network. There are more than 900 stations continuously transmitting readings from across Western states and Alaska. They\u2019re equipped with sensors that measure air temperature, snow depth, and soil moisture, and include pressure-sensitive \u201csnow pillows\u201d that weigh the snow to determine the water content.\u00a0\nThe data from the snow surveys and SNOTEL sites all flows into snow depth and snow water content reports that the NRCS publishes, along with forecasts of the amount of water that will fill the streams and reservoirs through the spring and summer.\nTaking the temperature\nNone of these survey and monitoring programs, however, provide the temperature throughout the snowpack.\u00a0\nThe Sierra Nevada snowpack can reach more than 6 meters (20 feet), and the temperature within it may vary widely, especially toward the top. Readings taken at increments throughout can determine what\u2019s known as the cold content, or the amount of energy required to shift the snowpack to a uniform temperature of 32\u02daF.\u00a0\nKnowing the cold content of the snowpack helps researchers understand the conditions under which it will begin to rapidly melt, particularly as it warms up in the spring or after rain falls on top of the snow.\nIf the temperature of the snow, for example, is close to 32\u02daF even at several feet deep, a few warm days could easily set it melting. If, on the other hand, the temperature measurements show a colder profile throughout the middle, the snowpack is more stable and will hold up longer as the weather warms.\n\nBjoern Bingham, a research scientist at the Desert Research Institute, digs at snowpit at a research plot within the Heavenly Ski Resort, near South Lake Tahoe, California. JAMES TEMPLE\n\n\nThe problem is that taking the temperature of the entire snowpack has been, until now, tough and time-consuming work. When researchers do it at all, they mainly do so by digging snow pits down to the ground and then taking readings with probe thermometers along an inside wall.There have been a variety of efforts to take continuous remote readings from sensors attached to fences, wires, or towers, which the snowpack eventually buries. But the movement and weight of the dense shifting snow tends to break the devices or snap the structures they\u2019re assembled upon.\n\u201cThey rarely last a season,\u201d McAvoy says.\nAnne Heggli, a professor of mountain hydrometeorology at DRI, happened upon the idea of using an infrared device to solve this problem during a tour of the institute\u2019s campus in 2019, when she learned that researchers there were using an infrared meat thermometer to take contactless readings of the snow surface.\nIn 2021, Heggli began collaborating with RPM Systems, a gadget manufacturing company, to design an infrared device optimized for snowpack field conditions. The resulting snow temperature profiler is skinny enough to fit down a hole dug by snow surveyors and dangles on a cord marked off at 10-centimeter (4-inch) increments.\n\nBingham and Daniel McEvoy, an associate research professor at the Desert Research Institute, work together to take temperature readings from inside the snowpit as well as from within the hole left behind by a snow sampler.JAMES TEMPLE\n\n\nAt Heavenly on that April morning, Bingham, a staff scientist at DRI, slowly fed the device down a snow sampler hole, calling out temperature readings at each marking. McEvoy scribbled them down on a worksheet fastened to his clipboard as he used a probe thermometer to take readings of his own from within a snow pit the pair had dug down to the ground.\nThey were comparing the measurements to assess the reliability of the infrared device in the field, but the eventual aim is to eliminate the need to dig snow pits. The hope is that state and federal surveyors could simply carry along a snow temperature profiler and drop it into the snowpack survey holes they\u2019re creating anyway, to gather regular snowpack temperature readings from across the mountains.\nIn 2023, the US Bureau of Reclamation, the federal agency that operates many of the nation\u2019s dams, funded a three-year research project to explore the use of the infrared gadgets in determining snowpack temperatures. Through it, the DRI research team has now handed devices out to 20 snow survey teams across California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Utah to test their use in the field and supplement the snowpack data they\u2019re collecting.\nThe Snow Lab\nThe DRI research project is one piece of a wider effort to obtain snowpack temperature data across the mountains of the West.\nBy early May, the snow depth had dropped from an April peak of 114 inches to 24 inches (2.9 meters to 0.6 meters) at the UC Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab, an aging wooden structure perched in the high mountains northwest of Lake Tahoe.Megan Mason, a research scientist at the lab, used a backcountry ski shovel to dig out a trio of instruments from what was left of the pitted snowpack behind the building. Each one featured different types of temperature sensors, arrayed along a strong polymer beam meant to hold up under the weight and movement of the Sierra snowpack.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe was pulling up the devices after running the last set of observations for the season, as part of an effort to develop a resilient system that can survive the winter and transmit hourly temperature readings.\nThe lab is working on the project, dubbed the California Cold Content Initiative, in collaboration with the state\u2019s Department of Water Resources. California is the only western state that opted to maintain its own snow survey program and run its own permanent monitoring stations, all of which are managed by the water department.\u00a0\nThe plan is to determine which instruments held up and functioned best this winter. Then, they can begin testing the most promising approaches at several additional sites next season. Eventually, the goal is to attach the devices at more than 100 of California\u2019s snow monitoring stations, says Andrew Schwartz, the director of the lab.The NRCS is conducting a similar research effort at select SNOTEL sites equipped with a beaded temperature cable. One such cable is visible at the Heavenly SNOTEL station, next to where McEvoy and Bingham dug their snow pit, strung vertically between an arm extended from the main tower and the snow-covered ground.\u00a0\n\nDRI\u2019s Bjoern Bingham feeds the snow temperature profiler, an infrared device, down a hole in the Sierra snowpack.JAMES TEMPLE\n\n\nSchwartz said that the different research groups are communicating and collaborating openly on the projects, all of which promise to provide complementary information, expanding the database of snowpack temperature readings across the West.\nFor decades, agencies and researchers generally produced water forecasts using relatively simple regression models that translated the amount of water in the snowpack into the amount of water that will flow down the mountain, based largely on the historic relationships between those variables.\u00a0\nBut these models are becoming less reliable as climate change alters temperatures, snow levels, melt rates, and evaporation, and otherwise drives alpine weather patterns outside of historic patterns.\n\u201cAs we have years that scatter further and more frequently from the norm, our models aren\u2019t prepared,\u201d Heggli says.\nPlugging direct temperature observations into more sophisticated models that have emerged in recent years, Schwartz says, promises to significantly improve the accuracy of water forecasts. That, in turn, should help communities manage through droughts and prevent dams from overtopping even as climate change fuels alternately wetter, drier, warmer, and weirder weather.\nAbout a quarter of the world\u2019s population relies on water stored in mountain snow and glaciers, and climate change is disrupting the hydrological cycles that sustain these natural frozen reservoirs in many parts of the world. So any advances in observations and modeling could deliver broader global benefits.\nOminous weather\nThere\u2019s an obvious threat to this progress, though.\nEven if these projects work as well as hoped, it\u2019s not clear how widely these tools and techniques will be deployed at a time when the White House is gutting staff across federal agencies, terminating thousands of scientific grants, and striving to eliminate tens of billions of dollars in funding at research departments.\u00a0\nThe Trump administration has fired or put on administrative leave nearly 6,000 employees across the USDA, or 6% of the department\u2019s workforce. Those cutbacks have reached regional NRCS offices, according to reporting by local and trade outlets.\nThat includes more than half of the roles at the Portland office, according to O\u2019Neill, the state climatologist. Those reductions prompted a bipartisan group of legislators to call on the Secretary of Agriculture to restore the positions, warning the losses could impair water data and analyses that are crucial for the state\u2019s \u201cagriculture, wildland fire, hydropower, timber, and tourism sectors,\u201d as the Statesman Journal reported.\nThere are more than 80 active SNOTEL stations in Oregon.\nThe fear is there won\u2019t be enough people left to reach all the sites this summer to replace batteries, solar panels, and drifting or broken sensors, which could quickly undermine the reliability of the data or cut off the flow of information.\u00a0\n\u201cStaff and budget reductions at NRCS will make it impossible to maintain SNOTEL instruments and conduct routine manual observations, leading to inoperability of the network within a year,\u201d the lawmakers warned.\nThe USDA and NRCS didn\u2019t respond to inquiries from MIT Technology Review.\u00a0\n\nDRI\u2019s Daniel McEvoy scribbles down temperature readings at the Heavenly site.JAMES TEMPLE\n\n\nIf the federal cutbacks deplete the data coming back from SNOTEL stations or federal snow survey work, the DRI infrared method could at least \u201cstill offer a simplistic way of measuring the snowpack temperatures\u201d in places where state and regional agencies continue to carry out surveys, McEvoy says.\nBut most researchers stress the field needs more surveys, stations, sensors, and readings to understand how the climate and water cycles are changing from month to month and season to season. Heggli stresses that there should be broad bipartisan support for programs that collect snowpack data and provide the water forecasts that farmers and communities rely on.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is how we account for one of, if not the, most valuable resource we have,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the West, we go into a seasonal drought every summer; our snowpack is what trickles down and gets us through that drought. We need to know how much we have.\u201d",

I found some big developments, like officers getting AI to write their police reports. Today, I published a new story that shows just how far AI for police has developed since then.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s about a new method police departments and federal agencies have found to track people: an AI tool that uses attributes like body size, gender, hair color and style, clothing, and accessories instead of faces. It offers a way around laws curbing the use of facial recognition, which are on the rise.\u00a0\nAdvocates from the ACLU, after learning of the tool through MIT Technology Review, said it was the first instance they\u2019d seen of such a tracking system used at scale in the US, and they say it has a high potential for abuse by federal agencies. They say the prospect that AI will enable more powerful surveillance is especially alarming at a time when the Trump administration is pushing for more monitoring of protesters, immigrants, and students.\u00a0\nI hope you read the full story for the details, and to watch a demo video of how the system works. But first, let\u2019s talk for a moment about what this tells us about the development of police tech and what rules, if any, these departments are subject to in the age of AI.\nAs I pointed out in my story six months ago, police departments in the US have extraordinary independence. There are more than 18,000 departments in the country, and they generally have lots of discretion over what technology they spend their budgets on. In recent years, that technology has increasingly become AI-centric.\u00a0\nCompanies like Flock and Axon sell suites of sensors\u2014cameras, license plate readers, gunshot detectors, drones\u2014and then offer AI tools to make sense of that ocean of data (at last year\u2019s conference I saw schmoozing between countless AI-for-police startups and the chiefs they sell to on the expo floor). Departments say these technologies save time, ease officer shortages, and help cut down on response times.\u00a0\nThose sound like fine goals, but this pace of adoption raises an obvious question: Who makes the rules here? When does the use of AI cross over from efficiency into surveillance, and what type of transparency is owed to the public?\nIn some cases, AI-powered police tech is already driving a wedge between departments and the communities they serve. When the police in Chula Vista, California, were the first in the country to get special waivers from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly their drones farther than normal, they said the drones would be deployed to solve crimes and get people help sooner in emergencies. They\u2019ve had some successes.\u00a0\nBut the department has also been sued by a local media outlet alleging it has reneged on its promise to make drone footage public, and residents have said the drones buzzing overhead feel like an invasion of privacy. An investigation found that these drones were deployed more often in poor neighborhoods, and for minor issues like loud music.\u00a0\nJay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU, says there\u2019s no overarching federal law that governs how local police departments adopt technologies like the tracking software I wrote about. Departments usually have the leeway to try it first, and see how their communities react after the fact. (Veritone, which makes the tool I wrote about, said they couldn\u2019t name or connect me with departments using it so the details of how it\u2019s being deployed by police are not yet clear).\u00a0\nSometimes communities take a firm stand; local laws against police use of facial recognition have been passed around the country. But departments\u2014or the police tech companies they buy from\u2014can find workarounds. Stanley says the new tracking software I wrote about poses lots of the same issues as facial recognition while escaping scrutiny because it doesn\u2019t technically use biometric data.\n\u201cThe community should be very skeptical of this kind of tech and, at a minimum, ask a lot of questions,\u201d he says. He laid out a road map of what police departments should do before they adopt AI technologies: have hearings with the public, get community permission, and make promises about how the systems will and will not be used. He added that the companies making this tech should also allow it to be tested by independent parties.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is all coming down the pike,\u201d he says\u2014and so quickly that policymakers and the public have little time to keep up.

    "summary": "Police and federal agencies have found a controversial new way to skirt the growing patchwork of laws that curb how they use facial recognition: an AI model that can track people using attributes like body size, gender, hair color and style, clothing, and accessories.\u00a0\nThe tool, called Track and built by the video analytics company Veritone, is used by 400 customers, including state and local police departments and universities all over the US. It is also expanding federally: US attorneys at the Department of Justice began using Track for criminal investigations last August. Veritone\u2019s broader suite of AI tools, which includes bona fide facial recognition, is also used by the Department of Homeland Security\u2014which houses immigration agencies\u2014and the Department of Defense, according to the company.\u00a0\n\u201cThe whole vision behind Track in the first place,\u201d says Veritone CEO Ryan Steelberg, was \u201cif we\u2019re not allowed to track people\u2019s faces, how do we assist in trying to potentially identify criminals or malicious behavior or activity?\u201d In addition to tracking individuals where facial recognition isn\u2019t legally allowed, Steelberg says, it allows for tracking when faces are obscured or not visible.\u00a0\nThe product has drawn criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union, which\u2014after learning of the tool through MIT Technology Review\u2014said it was the first instance they\u2019d seen of a nonbiometric tracking system used at scale in the US. They warned that it raises many of the same privacy concerns as facial recognition but also introduces new ones at a time when the Trump administration is pushing federal agencies to ramp up monitoring of protesters, immigrants, and students.\nVeritone gave us a demonstration of Track in which it analyzed people in footage from different environments, ranging from the January 6 riots to subway stations. You can use it to find people by specifying body size, gender, hair color and style, shoes, clothing, and various accessories. The tool can then assemble timelines, tracking a person across different locations and video feeds. It can be accessed through Amazon and Microsoft cloud platforms.\nVERITONE; MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW (CAPTIONS)\n\nIn an interview, Steelberg said that the number of attributes Track uses to identify people will continue to grow. When asked if Track differentiates on the basis of skin tone, a company spokesperson said it\u2019s one of the attributes the algorithm uses to tell people apart but that the software does not currently allow users to search for people by skin color. Track currently operates only on recorded video, but Steelberg claims the company is less than a year from being able to run it on live video feeds.\nAgencies using Track can add footage from police body cameras, drones, public videos on YouTube, or so-called citizen upload footage (from Ring cameras or cell phones, for example) in response to police requests. \n\u201cWe like to call this our Jason Bourne app,\u201d Steelberg says. He expects the technology to come under scrutiny in court cases but says, \u201cI hope we\u2019re exonerating people as much as we\u2019re helping police find the bad guys.\u201d The public sector currently accounts for only 6% of Veritone\u2019s business (most of its clients are media and entertainment companies), but the company says that\u2019s its fastest-growing market, with clients in places including California, Washington, Colorado, New Jersey, and Illinois.\u00a0\nThat rapid expansion has started to cause alarm in certain quarters. Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU, wrote in 2019 that artificial intelligence would someday expedite the tedious task of combing through surveillance footage, enabling automated analysis regardless of whether a crime has occurred. Since then, lots of police-tech companies have been building video analytics systems that can, for example, detect when a person enters a certain area. However, Stanley says, Track is the first product he\u2019s seen make broad tracking of particular people technologically feasible at scale.\n\u201cThis is a potentially authoritarian technology,\u201d he says. \u201cOne that gives great powers to the police and the government that will make it easier for them, no doubt, to solve certain crimes, but will also make it easier for them to overuse this technology, and to potentially abuse it.\u201d\nChances of such abusive surveillance, Stanley says, are particularly high right now in the federal agencies where Veritone has customers. The Department of Homeland Security said last month that it will monitor the social media activities of immigrants and use evidence it finds there to deny visas and green cards, and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has detained activists following pro-Palestinian statements or appearances at protests.\u00a0\nIn an interview, Jon Gacek, general manager of Veritone\u2019s public-sector business, said that Track is a \u201cculling tool\u201d meant to speed up the task of identifying important parts of videos, not a general surveillance tool. Veritone did not specify which groups within the Department of Homeland Security or other federal agencies use Track.\u00a0The Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. \nFor police departments, the tool dramatically expands the amount of video that can be used in investigations. Whereas facial recognition requires footage in which faces are clearly visible, Track doesn\u2019t have that limitation. Nathan Wessler, an attorney for the ACLU, says this means police might comb through videos they had no interest in before.\u00a0\n\u201cIt creates a categorically new scale and nature of privacy invasion and potential for abuse that was literally not possible any time before in human history,\u201d Wessler says. \u201cYou\u2019re now talking about not speeding up what a cop could do, but creating a capability that no cop ever had before.\u201d\nTrack\u2019s expansion comes as laws limiting the use of facial recognition have spread, sparked by wrongful arrests in which officers have been overly confident in the judgments of algorithms.\u00a0 Numerous studies have shown that such algorithms are less accurate with nonwhite faces. Laws in Montana and Maine sharply limit when police can use it\u2014it\u2019s not allowed in real time with live video\u2014while San Francisco and Oakland, California have near-complete bans on facial recognition. Track provides an alternative.\u00a0\nThough such laws often reference \u201cbiometric data,\u201d Wessler says this phrase is far from clearly defined. It generally refers to immutable characteristics like faces, gait and fingerprints rather than things that change, like clothing. But certain attributes, such as body size, blur this distinction.\u00a0\nConsider also, Wessler says, someone in winter who frequently wears the same boots, coat, and backpack. \u201cTheir profile is going to be the same day after day,\u201d Wessler says. \u201cThe potential to track somebody over time based on how they\u2019re moving across a whole bunch of different saved video feeds is pretty equivalent to face recognition.\u201d\nIn other words, Track might provide a way of following someone that raises many of the same concerns as facial recognition, but isn\u2019t subject to laws restricting use of facial recognition because it does not technically involve biometric data. Steelberg said there are several ongoing cases that include video evidence from Track, but that he couldn\u2019t name the cases or comment further. So for now, it\u2019s unclear whether it\u2019s being adopted in jurisdictions where facial recognition is banned.\u00a0",

This scenario is the inspiration for a new AI headphone system that translates the speech of multiple speakers simultaneously, in real time.\nHow it works: The system tracks the direction and vocal characteristics of each speaker, helping the person wearing the headphones to identify who is saying what in a group setting. Read the full story.\n\u2014Rhiannon Williams\n\nYour gut microbes might encourage criminal behavior\nA few years ago, a Belgian man in his 30s drove into a lamppost. Twice. Local authorities found that his blood alcohol level was four times the legal limit. Over the space of a few years, the man was apprehended for drunk driving three times. And on all three occasions, he insisted he hadn\u2019t been drinking.\nHe was telling the truth. A doctor later diagnosed auto-brewery syndrome\u2014a rare condition in which the body makes its own alcohol. Microbes living inside the man\u2019s body were fermenting the carbohydrates in his diet to create ethanol.

This scenario is the inspiration for a new AI headphone system that translates the speech of multiple speakers simultaneously, in real time.\nHow it works: The system tracks the direction and vocal characteristics of each speaker, helping the person wearing the headphones to identify who is saying what in a group setting. Read the full story.\n\u2014Rhiannon Williams\n\nYour gut microbes might encourage criminal behavior\nA few years ago, a Belgian man in his 30s drove into a lamppost. Twice. Local authorities found that his blood alcohol level was four times the legal limit. Over the space of a few years, the man was apprehended for drunk driving three times. And on all three occasions, he insisted he hadn\u2019t been drinking.\nHe was telling the truth. A doctor later diagnosed auto-brewery syndrome\u2014a rare condition in which the body makes its own alcohol. Microbes living inside the man\u2019s body were fermenting the carbohydrates in his diet to create ethanol. Last year, he was acquitted of drunk driving.His case, along with several other scientific studies, raises a fascinating question for microbiology, neuroscience, and the law: How much of our behavior can we blame on our microbes?

It has lasted six years longer than that, though it is showing its age, and NASA is currently studying how to safely destroy the space laboratory by around 2030.The ISS never really became what some had hoped: a launching point for an expanding human presence in the solar system. But it did enable fundamental research on materials and medicine, and it helped us start to understand how space affects the human body.To build on that work, NASA has partnered with private companies to develop new, commercial space stations for research, manufacturing, and tourism. If they are successful, these companies will bring about a new era of space exploration: private rockets flying to private destinations. They\u2019re already planning to do it around the moon. One day, Mars could follow. Read the full story.\n\u2014David W. Brown\n\nWe can still have nice things\nA place for comfort, fun and distraction to brighten up your day. (Got any ideas?
