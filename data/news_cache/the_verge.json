    "summary": "\n\n\ufeffYou can get a great budget device these days if you know how to pick your priorities. | Image: The Verge\n\nSome of us take a kind of \u201cI eat to live\u201d rather than an \u201cI live to eat\u201d approach to gadgets. They\u2019re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that\u2019s you \u2014 and there\u2019s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd \u2014 then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.\nBudget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they\u2019re more capable than ever. You won\u2019t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don\u2019t know, actual bells and whistles. It\u2019s your world.\n\n\nHow we test\nThere\u2019s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life \u2014 stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid \u2014 everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become\u00a0so routine that it\u2019s mostly painless.\n\n\nStrong software support\nAt least a couple of years of OS upgrades and, ideally, three years of security updates. There\u2019s no point in buying even a cheap phone if you have to replace it after just a couple of years because it stopped getting security patches.\n\n\nA good screen\nSince you look at it roughly two thousand times a day, your phone\u2019s screen is one place you shouldn\u2019t compromise. An OLED has richer contrast and color than an LCD, and the big screens on today\u2019s phones really need at least a 1080p resolution. Faster refresh rates like 90Hz and even 120Hz are becoming more common on budget phone screens, but for my money, a smooth-scrolling LCD doesn\u2019t look as nice as an OLED with a standard refresh rate.\n\n\nServiceable storage space\nIf you plan to hang onto your phone for a while, you\u2019ll want enough storage space to accommodate all the system files, photos, and videos you\u2019ll accumulate over the years. Ideally you\u2019ll get at least 128GB built in.\u00a0\n\n\nOne good rear camera, not four mediocre ones\nUpgrades like telephoto cameras and optical image stabilization are rare in the under-$500 class, but you can still expect good, basic performance in good lighting from any modern smartphone. Low light is trickier. Phones in this class should offer a night mode to help with non-moving subjects in very dim light. And there are no bonus points awarded for adding extra macro and depth cameras to pad out the rear camera array \u2014 those 2- and 5-megapixel sensors are pretty much useless.\u00a0\n\n\nIn this article\n\n\nThe best budget iPhone\nThe best Android phone under $500\nThe best budget phone that performs like a flagship\nThe best phone under $400\nOther budget phones we tested\n\n\nWhat compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.\nThe best cheap iPhone\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nIf I was making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you\u2019d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs \u2014 some of which make more sense than others \u2014 and it\u2019s not exactly cheap. If you\u2019re amenable to last year\u2019s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.\nThere\u2019s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there\u2019s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That\u2019s an understandable tradeoff \u2014 so is the use of the older \u201cnotch\u201d design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it\u2019s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here \u2014 that\u2019s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can\u2019t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you\u2019ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.\nAnother heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won\u2019t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It\u2019s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming and the most interesting bits won\u2019t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple\u2019s AI. But don\u2019t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It\u2019s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it\u2019s the best price you\u2019ll find on a brand-new one.\nRead my full iPhone 16E review.\nThe best Android phone under $500\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend \u2014 and at $499, the price is right. \nThe phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn\u2019t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year\u2019s, which makes a difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also got a small boost up to IP68, which means it can survive a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.\nThe 9A\u2019s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A\u2019s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin.\nRead my full Google Pixel 9A review.\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nScreen: 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP65\nThe OnePlus 13R isn\u2019t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It\u2019s also a little pricier at $599 \u2014 though we\u2019ve seen it at $499 for extended periods of time \u2014 but for some people the 13R\u2019s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best big screens in its class, and lots of people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you\u2019re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.\nThere\u2019s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won\u2019t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against spray and rain showers, but it isn\u2019t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won\u2019t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience \u2014 especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A. \nRead my full OnePlus 13R review.\nThe best phone under $400\nScreen: 6.6-inch, 1080p resolution, 120Hz OLED / Processor: Exynos 1380 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 5-megapixel macro, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 25W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP67\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 5G comes with surprisingly strong specs for its $399 price. They\u2019re the kind of features you won\u2019t really spot from the outside, but they\u2019re important, particularly its IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. Unlike virtually every other phone at this price, the A35 5G is built to withstand water immersion, so you don\u2019t need to sweat it if your phone lands in a toilet bowl or puddle.\nHere\u2019s another unexciting spec: four years of OS updates and five years of security updates. That\u2019s not the very best in the budget category \u2014 the Pixel 9A takes that honor with seven years of updates \u2014 but it\u2019s much better than the two or three years we typically see in phones well under $500.\n\nThe camera is lackluster; it\u2019s fine in bright light but struggles in dim and mixed indoor lighting. It doesn\u2019t have the strongest processing performance you can find under $500, either, and the Samsung-made Exynos processor occasionally stutters when quickly bouncing between tasks. I was horrified \u2014 horrified! \u2014 when I accidentally texted my husband one of the automatically generated replies because it popped up at the last moment as I was trying to tap on something else. These things don\u2019t happen when everything loads quickly.\nBut overall, it\u2019s a compelling package \u2014 especially with a big, crowd-pleasing OLED display and strong battery performance. If you\u2019re a light user and not fussy about camera quality, the A35 5G offers some upgrades that make a real difference in the long term.\nOther budget phones we tested\n\nThe 2024 Motorola Moto G Power has all the makings of a good budget phone, including a lovely vegan leather exterior and wireless charging. But it\u2019s loaded with bloatware of the worst kind, and that alone disqualifies it from our recommendations. Read our impressions.\n\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is another perfectly capable phone that doesn\u2019t quite earn a recommendation here. It\u2019s a little outside the scope of this guide at $649 anyway, but you do get a telephoto lens and a nice, big screen for that price. Still, you\u2019re better off saving a bunch and picking up the Pixel 8A or trying to score a trade-in promo for the newer Galaxy S25. Read our review.\n\nUpdate, June 13th: Updated prices and availability. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy A35 5G is currently out of stock at Amazon and Samsung, while Best Buy has it marked down on clearance.",
    "content": "\n\n\ufeffYou can get a great budget device these days if you know how to pick your priorities. | Image: The Verge\n\nSome of us take a kind of \u201cI eat to live\u201d rather than an \u201cI live to eat\u201d approach to gadgets. They\u2019re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that\u2019s you \u2014 and there\u2019s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd \u2014 then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.\nBudget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they\u2019re more capable than ever. You won\u2019t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don\u2019t know, actual bells and whistles. It\u2019s your world.\n\n\nHow we test\nThere\u2019s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life \u2014 stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid \u2014 everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become\u00a0so routine that it\u2019s mostly painless.\n\n\nStrong software support\nAt least a couple of years of OS upgrades and, ideally, three years of security updates. There\u2019s no point in buying even a cheap phone if you have to replace it after just a couple of years because it stopped getting security patches.\n\n\nA good screen\nSince you look at it roughly two thousand times a day, your phone\u2019s screen is one place you shouldn\u2019t compromise. An OLED has richer contrast and color than an LCD, and the big screens on today\u2019s phones really need at least a 1080p resolution. Faster refresh rates like 90Hz and even 120Hz are becoming more common on budget phone screens, but for my money, a smooth-scrolling LCD doesn\u2019t look as nice as an OLED with a standard refresh rate.\n\n\nServiceable storage space\nIf you plan to hang onto your phone for a while, you\u2019ll want enough storage space to accommodate all the system files, photos, and videos you\u2019ll accumulate over the years. Ideally you\u2019ll get at least 128GB built in.\u00a0\n\n\nOne good rear camera, not four mediocre ones\nUpgrades like telephoto cameras and optical image stabilization are rare in the under-$500 class, but you can still expect good, basic performance in good lighting from any modern smartphone. Low light is trickier. Phones in this class should offer a night mode to help with non-moving subjects in very dim light. And there are no bonus points awarded for adding extra macro and depth cameras to pad out the rear camera array \u2014 those 2- and 5-megapixel sensors are pretty much useless.\u00a0\n\n\nIn this article\n\n\nThe best budget iPhone\nThe best Android phone under $500\nThe best budget phone that performs like a flagship\nThe best phone under $400\nOther budget phones we tested\n\n\nWhat compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.\nThe best cheap iPhone\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nIf I was making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you\u2019d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs \u2014 some of which make more sense than others \u2014 and it\u2019s not exactly cheap. If you\u2019re amenable to last year\u2019s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.\nThere\u2019s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there\u2019s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That\u2019s an understandable tradeoff \u2014 so is the use of the older \u201cnotch\u201d design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it\u2019s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here \u2014 that\u2019s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can\u2019t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you\u2019ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.\nAnother heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won\u2019t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It\u2019s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming and the most interesting bits won\u2019t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple\u2019s AI. But don\u2019t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It\u2019s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it\u2019s the best price you\u2019ll find on a brand-new one.\nRead my full iPhone 16E review.\nThe best Android phone under $500\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend \u2014 and at $499, the price is right. \nThe phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn\u2019t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year\u2019s, which makes a difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also got a small boost up to IP68, which means it can survive a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.\nThe 9A\u2019s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A\u2019s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin.\nRead my full Google Pixel 9A review.\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nScreen: 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP65\nThe OnePlus 13R isn\u2019t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It\u2019s also a little pricier at $599 \u2014 though we\u2019ve seen it at $499 for extended periods of time \u2014 but for some people the 13R\u2019s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best big screens in its class, and lots of people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you\u2019re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.\nThere\u2019s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won\u2019t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against spray and rain showers, but it isn\u2019t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won\u2019t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience \u2014 especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A. \nRead my full OnePlus 13R review.\nThe best phone under $400\nScreen: 6.6-inch, 1080p resolution, 120Hz OLED / Processor: Exynos 1380 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 5-megapixel macro, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 25W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP67\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 5G comes with surprisingly strong specs for its $399 price.

Right now, it\u2019s on sale for $99.99 ($30 off) at Amazon in black and white color schemes. That\u2019s both its best price to date and the cheapest it has sold for in months.\nThis Qi2-certified charger can quickly charge MagSafe compatible iPhones, delivering up to 15W of power. What\u2019s more, it also supports fast charging for Apple Watch models starting with the Series 7 via a dedicated 5W puck. There\u2019s another 5W Qi pad at its base that\u2019s ideal for topping off a second device that supports wireless charging, like a pair of AirPods, or an Android phone. However you mix and match devices, it can charge all three pads simultaneously without compromising speed, a feature we expect from good charging stations.\nBeyond charging, the BoostCharge Pro also functions as a sturdy, upright stand\u2014perfect for quickly glancing at notifications or turning your iPhone into a nightstand display. It\u2019s compatible with StandBy mode on iOS, so you can use your phone as a clock, calendar, or photo frame while it charges.\n\nThree more deals worth a look\n\nWoot is selling the Apple Pencil USB-C for just $59.99 ($20 off) through July 1st, which is one of its best prices to date. The handy stylus offers tilt sensitivity, but lacks the pressure sensitivity or wireless charging found in the pricier Apple Pencil Pro, but it still can magnetically attach to the side of most\u00a0 iPad models from the past three or so years.\u00a0\nYou can buy the Anker Prime TB5 Docking Station for $359.99 ($40 off) at Amazon and Anker (with code WS7DV2HJI8AT), which is a new low price on the Thunderbolt 5 dock. The powerful dock can connect everything from smartphones and laptops to dual 8K displays, boasting 14 ports in total and delivering up to 232W of combined power output. You\u2019ll also find several USB-C ports, including an upstream Thunderbolt 5 USB-C port capable of delivering up to 140W to your laptop. Rounding things out, the dock includes both SD and microSD card slots conveniently located on the side, along with HDMI, DisplayPort, an ethernet port, a headphone jack, and multiple USB-A ports.\u00a0\nYou can buy the Eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 E20 for $379.99 ($270 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is its best price to date. The self-emptying robot vacuum offers 8,000Pa of suction, along with mapping, scheduling, and no-go zones. What makes it really stand out, though, is that it can convert into a stick and handheld vacuum, offering a powerful 30,000Pa of suction for a more thorough clean.\u00a0\n",
