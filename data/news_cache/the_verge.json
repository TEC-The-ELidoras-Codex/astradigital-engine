    "summary": "\n\nA number of excellent models are on sale right now, including the SwitchBot S10. | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n\nWe\u2019re in an age where you can realistically delegate tasks to smart hunks of metal, whether it\u2019s a self-driving car or a robot that can clean on your behalf. Most of us probably won\u2019t be able to afford the helpful sentient humanoids being developed in our lifetimes, but robot vacuums are an affordable way to experience that promised utopia right now.\nToday\u2019s floor cleaners are also more advanced than ever. In addition to vacuuming, many of the best models can now mop, allowing you to tackle both carpet and hardwood flooring. Some can automatically dispense of their trash and dirty water, too, and clean their own components without intervention. Soon, we\u2019ll even have models that can pick up dirty laundry and purify the air in your home, preventing you from having to lift a finger.\n\n\nThe best Roborock dealsThe best Dreame dealsThe best SwitchBot dealsThe best Eufy dealsThe best Yeedi dealsThe best Shark dealsOther robot vacuum deals\n\nBut if you need something relatively affordable for daily cleaning, you\u2019d be surprised how little you have to pay for premium features. Below, we\u2019ve listed the best deals currently available on a slate of Verge-approved robot vacuums, whether you prefer a budget entry-level model from Yeedi or a top-of-the-line offering from iRobot, Dreame, and more.\nThe best Roborock deals\nRoborock\u2019s S8 MaxV Ultra \u2014 our pick for the best robot vacuum overall \u2014 is available from Best Buy, Roborock, and Amazon for $1,299.99 ($500 off), which is $200 shy of its best price to date. The combination of a 10,000Pa suction power and dual rubber roller brushes makes it a terrific vacuum, one that can easily pick up pet hair and other debris. It can also mop with great efficiency thanks to a sonic mopping system that vibrates the mop pad 4,000 times a minute, allowing it to clean sticky juices, thick condiments, and other common spills. The mop arm can extend to cover corners and baseboard edges, too.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra\u2019s camera-equipped AI obstacle avoidance makes it the best navigator in Roborock\u2019s lineup and one of the top models overall, though it\u2019s not quite as strong as Roomba\u2019s. The mobile app offers ample options to customize cleaning zones and schedules, and you can use its dedicated voice assistant to start and stop routines. It\u2019s also a Matter-ready robot that\u2019s compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home.\nThe Roborock S8 Plus is another great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that\u2019s available for $519.99 ($480 off) \u2014 its second-best price to date \u2014 from Walmart and Roborock. It offers a vibrating mop pad that scrubs floors well, and, like the S8 MaxV Ultra, it features dual rubber roller brushes. It\u2019s not as powerful as the MaxV Ultra given its 6,000Pa of suction, but it still does a good job of sucking up dirt from carpets. It also lacks a water tank, though you do get good obstacle detection and a smaller auto-empty dock that saves space.\nThe best Dreame deals\nThe Dreame X40 Ultra is another mopping robot, and while it\u2019s on the more expensive side, you can currently pick it up for $999.99 ($500 off) \u2014 $100 shy of its all-time low \u2014 from Dreame and Amazon. You\u2019re paying a premium for 12,000Pa of suction power and a pair of removable, self-retracting mop pads, which it can automatically clean and dry on its own using the included base. It can also empty its own bin and refill its own water tank.\nThe Dreame X40 Ultra features an extendable side brush and mop pads, too, offering better coverage for baseboards, corners, and the underside of your furniture. It uses a combination of AI-powered cameras and \u201c3D-structured light\u201d (presumably based on lidar technology) to map and navigate rooms, with customizable keep-out zones and more functions available in the app. There\u2019s also a dirt detection system that can identify messier spills and adjust its cleaning routine accordingly.\nThe Dream L20 Ultra is available for an all-time low of $549.98 ($450 off) at Amazon. The L20 Ultra is an excellent alternative to Dreame\u2019s newer flagship robots, including the X40. It lacks a bit of power in comparison, though its 7,000Pa of suction power is still enough for most cleaning jobs. It also doesn\u2019t have the L40\u2019s tri-cut brush, which makes the step-up model more efficient at picking up pet hair. The only other real advantage the X40 holds over the L20 is its self-extending arms for vacuuming (though the dual mop pads can extend a bit for baseboard and corner coverage), nor does it have dirt detection.\nThe L20 Ultra\u2019s base station is rather large, but it can take care of the entire cleaning process, including emptying the dustbin, emptying and refilling the water tanks, and washing and drying the mop pads. It doesn\u2019t have a heated cleaning function for the mop pads, however. It uses a lidar-based AI-powered navigation system, and you can prompt it to start cleaning by voice using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.\nThe best SwitchBot deals\nThe SwitchBot S10 is available with a free water tank for $459.99 ($740 off)\u00a0\u2014 $69 shy of its all-time low \u2014 when you check out via Roborock\u2019s online storefront with promo code MDYLOM. The S10 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum / mop hybrids you can buy, one that can refill its own tank so long as you hook the battery-powered base station into your home\u2019s plumbing. It can also dry its own mop pads and empty its own bin at a separate docking bay, and offers enough capacity to run for up to 90 days without intervention.\nThe S10\u2019s self-cleaning roller mop is more effective than the typical pads we see in most other units, but it\u2019s also limited to a smaller coverage area. It only has a single roller brush for vacuuming, but its respectable 6,500Pa suction can make up for it. And while it has lidar mapping and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, we found it still has a tendency to get stuck on laundry, bath mats, and other obstacles. The S10 is also one of the few robovacs with Matter support, however, which effectively enables native control through Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa (though said platforms don\u2019t yet fully support robot vacuums).\nRead our SwitchBot S10 review.\nThe SwitchBot K10 Plus is also available for an all-time low of $199.99 ($200 off) directly from SwitchBot with promo code LMTM120. At 3.6 inches high and 9.8 inches wide, it\u2019s a more petite option if you want something that can maneuver tighter spaces, which it does to decent success with a lidar-based mapping system that supports digital keep-out zones. It only has 2,500Pa suction, but that should be powerful enough to lift dirt in all but the deepest carpeting. You can also attach disposable mopping pads, though their mopping function doesn\u2019t work well. The K10 Plus comes with a self-emptying dock that can hold a respectable four liters of dirt before it needs emptying.\nThe best Eufy deals\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni, our current pick for the best midrange robot vacuum / mop, is now available at Amazon for $699.99 ($100 off), which is about $150 shy of the all-time low we last saw during Amazon\u2019s Big Spring Sale. You can also grab it directly from Eufy for the same price when you use promo code WS24T2351121 at checkout.\nThe X10 Pro Omni is a bit of a novelty, at least in comparison to other robovacs in its price range, in that it offers AI-powered obstacle detection, which allows it to deftly navigate cables and other clutter. It also features a slew of functions you\u2019d expect from top-of-the-line models, including 8,000Pa of suction power, speedy lidar-powered mapping, and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping.\nMind you, none of these features are as effective as they are on more premium models, though the result is an all-in-one bot that punches above its weight. Plus, it has heated mop drying and onboard water reservoir, the latter of which prevents it from having to return to its multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock too frequently.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a bump-and-roll model that\u2019s relatively budget-friendly, the Eufy 11S Max is on sale at Amazon for just $159.99 ($90 off). The 11S Max stands out from other robovacs because it doesn\u2019t use Wi-Fi, meaning it doesn\u2019t require you to fiddle with a mobile app on your phone. Instead, you can control it using an on-board button or with the included remote, which also allows you to create cleaning schedules. It\u2019s relatively quiet and reliable, too, with 2,000Pa of suction power and replaceable parts, making it a great long-term investment for those who want something basic.\nThe best Yeedi deals\nThe Yeedi Cube is currently down to an all-time low of $246.99 ($243 off) at Amazon for Prime members. It\u2019s not easy to find a self-emptying / self-cleaning vacuum at this price, as those features are typically only available on robots that cost upward of $600 or more.\nWith 5,100Pa of suction power, the Cube can tackle most common vacuuming scenarios, though its single hybrid rubber / bristle brush can get easily tangled with pet hair. It mops better than most models in its range, however, namely because its vibrating microfiber pads can actually scrub your floors. The Cube uses lasers for object avoidance, too, though it\u2019s not as effective for navigation as those with lidar and AI smarts. It can avoid large furniture and other objects, but it might need your help rerouting around cables, toys, and laundry. Still, we found it navigates better than most other robots under $300.\nThe best Shark deals\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 is a great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that\u2019s now on sale for an all-time low of $379.99 ($320 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and directly from Shark. Before the Eufy X10 Pro Omni took its place, the Matrix Plus 2-in-1 was our runner-up pick for those seeking a midrange robot vacuum that mops and automatically empties its own bin. Its vibrating, sonic mopping feature does an excellent job of scrubbing hardwood floors; however, keep in mind that you\u2019ll have to fill and attach the mop reservoir manually.\n\nOther robot vacuum deals\nUpdate, May 13th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and several new deals, including one for the Deebot X8 Pro Omni.\n",

On Sunday, a Republican-led House committee submitted a budget reconciliation bill that proposes blocking states from enforcing \u201cany law or regulation\u201d targeting an exceptionally broad range of automated computing systems for 10 years after the law is enacted \u2014 a move that would stall efforts to regulate everything from AI chatbots to online search results.\u00a0\nDemocrats are calling the new provision a \u201cgiant gift\u201d to Big Tech, and organizations that promote AI oversight, like Americans for Responsible Innovation (ARI), say it could have \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d for the public. It\u2019s a gift companies like OpenAI have recently been seeking in Washington, aiming to avoid a slew of pending and active state laws. The budget reconciliation process allows lawmakers to fast-track bills related to government spending by requiring only a majority in the Senate rather than 60 votes to pass.\u00a0\nThis bill, introduced by House Committee on Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-KY), would prevent states from imposing \u201clegal impediments\u201d \u2014\u00a0or restrictions to design, performance, civil liability, and documentation \u2014 on AI models and \u201cautomated decision\u201d systems.

Travis Hall, the director for state engagement at the Center for Democracy & Technology, tells The Verge that the automated decision systems described in the bill \u201cpermeate digital services, from search results and mapping directions, to health diagnoses and risk analyses for sentencing decisions.\u201d\nDuring the 2025 legislative session, states have proposed over 500 laws that Hall says this bill could \u201cunequivocally block.\u201d They focus on everything from chatbot safety for minors to deepfake restrictions and disclosures for the use of AI in political ads. If the bill passes, the handful of states that have successfully passed AI laws may also see their efforts go to waste.\u00a0\n\u201cThe move to ban AI safeguards is a giveaway to Big Tech that will come back to bite us.\u201d\nLast year, California Gov.

Colorado\u2019s AI law, which goes into effect next year, will require companies developing \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI systems to protect customers from \u201calgorithmic discrimination.\u201d\nCalifornia also came close to enacting the landmark AI safety law SB 1047, which would have imposed security restrictions and legal liability on AI companies based in the state, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta. OpenAI opposed the bill, saying AI regulation should take place at the federal level instead of having a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of state laws that could make it more difficult to comply. Gov. Newsom vetoed the bill last September, and OpenAI has made it clear it wants to avoid having state laws \u201cbogging down innovation\u201d in the future.\nWith so little AI regulation at the federal level, it\u2019s been left up to the states to decide how to deal with AI.\u00a0Even before the rise of generative AI, state legislators were grappling with how to fight algorithmic discrimination \u2014 including machine learning-based systems that display race or gender bias \u2014 in areas like housing and criminal justice.

Basically, all this was good for was getting up fine dirt that the vacuum left behind.\nA robot vacuum with a real mopping system will make your life easier\u00a0\nNewer models now come with vibrating or oscillating mop pads, and some even have roller mops. Most models have onboard water tanks to keep the mops wet while in use, and many can wash and dry their mops in their charging docks, which also automatically empty and refill their water tanks, meaning less work for you.\nWhile most robot vacuums today come with some sort of mopping feature, this guide focuses on those that excel at mopping. If you\u2019re more interested in the best vacuum, check out my guide to floor sweeping bots. \nThe downside to these combo bots with serious mopping chops is that they tend to be bigger and heavier and need more frequent intervention than regular vacuum bots. Water equals gunk, and cleaning their giant multifunction docks, even the self-cleaning ones, can be an icky job. You also have to empty and refill their tanks about once a week.\u00a0\nMopping bots also need to return to their docks more frequently than robot vacuums in order to refill their onboard water tanks. This means they\u2019ll take longer to clean your floors than a dedicated vacuuming model, but they are doing two jobs at once. Robot mops with roller mops will self-clean as they work, negating this issue, but these models are also the largest and bulkiest, as they carry a bigger water tank on board.\u00a0\nCombo bots can mop and vacuum simultaneously, but for especially dirty floors, it\u2019s best to have the option to vacuum first and then mop. A mop-only mode is also good, as you can send the bot to clean up a wet spill without it sucking up water \u2014 something they\u2019re not designed to do, yet.\nIf you have a lot of hardwood or tile floors and constantly struggle with muddy paw prints or the general dirtiness of life with multiple pets, people, and kids, a good robot vacuum and mop combo will definitely make your life easier.\u00a0\n\n\nBest robot vacuum and mopBest budget robot vacuum and mopBest midrange robot vacuum and mopBest robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugsBest robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floorsBest robot vacuum and mop for tile floorsBest robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookupHow I test robot vacuumsWhat I\u2019m currently testing and what\u2019s coming next\n\n\n\nA multifunction charging dock\nThis is a charging base that empties the robot\u2019s bin, washes and dries the bot\u2019s mops, and empties and refills its water tank. This is essential if you want to be as hands-free as possible when mopping your floor. Some offer hot water washing and drying options that will keep your pads cleaner for longer. But you\u2019ll want to throw them in the wash eventually. A dock that can self-clean the washboard (the area where it cleans the mops) is a nice upgrade, as you won\u2019t have to do it yourself as often.\n\n\nBig tanks (or a plumbing hookup)\nThe bigger the clean and dirty water tanks on the dock, the less often you\u2019ll have to refill them. If the dock can connect directly to the plumbing, even better; it\u2019s a more complicated install, but makes for a more hands-off experience long term.\n\n\nBetter mops\nMop type matters. The main options are circular and spinning, flat and vibrating, or rolling and self-cleaning. Rolling (like the beater bar on a vacuum cleaner) is my favorite because it does a better job of getting floors really clean. The greater surface area of a roller mop, combined with the self-cleaning function \u2014 the vac sprays water onto the mop as it runs \u2014 makes it a more effective option than flat or spinning mops in most cases. However, oscillating mops that can extend outwards are better at getting into grout between tiles, along baseboards, and under low furniture.\u00a0\n\n\nMops that lift or drop\nIf you have low-pile rugs and carpet, mop pads that the robot can lift up (by at least 10 mm) should prevent your carpets from getting damp when the robot rolls over them. However, robots that can remove the mop pads entirely before vacuuming carpets are a good option, especially if you have high-pile rugs.\n\n\nDecent mop pressure and speed\nSpecs around mop pressure and rotation speed are similar to those for suction power on the vacuum; they matter to some extent, but what\u2019s more important is how effective the pads are. The higher the pressure, the more effective it should be on tougher stains. The higher the rotations per minute (RPMs), the more friction the stain has to deal with. It\u2019s hard to judge pressure, as several manufacturers don\u2019t list it and those that do use different measurements, but 12 Newtons, roughly 2.2 pounds of downward pressure, is very good.\n\n\nA usable app\nA well-laid-out app is key. It should let you choose which rooms to clean, and in what order. Generally, you want a mopping bot to clean the dirtiest room last (think bathroom or hallway) to avoid cross-contamination. I also look for the option to mop only, in addition to mop and vacuum, or vacuum then mop, and, of course, vacuum only.\n\n\nBest robot vacuum and mop\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 4,000Pa at 200 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 10mm /\u00a0 Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 18,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber/bristle / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Matter support promised\nEcovacs\u2019 Deebot X8 Pro Omni is a welcome return to form for Ecovacs\u2019 flagship line. Its new tower-less lidar navigation system did a much better job of mapping and navigating than the previous flagship, the Deebot X2 Omni, which was constantly getting lost in my tests. However, the most notable thing about the X8 is the Ozmo Roller Mop.\u00a0\nThis is the best roller mopping bot I\u2019ve tested, thanks mostly to the Ozmo\u2019s ability to extend outwards to clean along baseboards and furniture. This is a unique feature on a roller mop (for now) that makes up for the mop\u2019s relatively short length (both the Eufy S1 and Switchbot S10 have longer roller mops).\u00a0At $1,299, the X8 is also one of the less expensive flagship models (though the new X9 Pro Omni retails for $1599.99).\n\n\nThe X8 did an excellent job on my milk, OJ, and dried ketchup tests, absorbing the small spills with one or two passes. It covered the floors evenly, without leaving any streaks or gaps, something that I\u2019ve seen happen with spinning mop pads. When it comes across an edge \u2014 be it a baseboard, furniture like a chair or table leg, or any obstacle \u2014 it extends out its mop to the right to clean as close as possible. It did an excellent job getting the grime up from the stools around my kitchen counter, something most other bots struggle to do.\nThis is the best roller mopping bot I\u2019ve tested\nThe self-cleaning brush system kept the bot from smearing any spills it encountered. As it\u2019s cleaning, a scraper squeegees off the dirty water and 16 nozzles spray it with fresh water and solution, if you use it. As with most high-end mopping bots, the dock has the option of auto-dispensing cleaning solution.\nThe X8 was the best vacuuming robot among the serious combo bots I tested, outperforming my Cheerio and oatmeal tests and doing a good job on rugs (when it could reach them). However, its vacuum has a relatively small, single rubber roller brush, which is less effective than Roborock\u2019s and Roomba\u2019s dual roller brush models (which include the S8 MaxV Ultra and the 10 Max).\n\n\nThe X8 uses lidar and a 3D camera for mapping; the latter also facilitates its obstacle detection, which is very good \u2014 it easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios. It\u2019s much better at navigating than the X2, but it did occasionally get itself trapped, including when it went under a chair that was too low for it to get out from. The top of the robot was fairly scratched up after just one week of use. (Worth noting, Ecovacs suffered a hack last year in which bad actors could access the camera and microphone on the X2)\nThe X8\u2019s multifunction dock is much smaller than the X2\u2019s and has some nice rose gold accents. Its water tanks are integrated into the dock and supereasy to remove to empty and refill \u2014 there\u2019s no lid to mess with, you just lift up and go. The X8 doesn\u2019t self-clean its washboard, however, and while it\u2019s removable to make it easier to clean, I still had to get on my knees and scrub its base station after just a week of use.\nIt easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios\nThe downside of roller mop bots is that they are big and heavy: the X8 weighs a whopping 12 pounds. Despite an ability to lift itself up to clear thresholds, the X8 isn\u2019t as agile as smaller, lighter robot vacs. It struggled with the combo challenge of a large, tasseled, high-pile rug and spindly chair leg. Very few robot vacs tackle that one well, but it got stuck on the chair leg and sucked up the rug tassels. I ended up setting a keep-out zone so it could complete its job.\nThe integrated nature of the roller mop means the bot can\u2019t remove it when it goes to vacuum carpet, as some mopping bots with pads can. It can lift it, but only 10mm, which isn\u2019t going to work for the fluffiest rugs. The X8 does have carpet sensors, and you can choose to avoid them automatically, pass over them, or vacuum only. But its best carpet feature is the option to have it vacuum the carpets first, then mop everywhere else.\u00a0\nOverall, the Deebot X8 is a stellar vacuum mop combo for anyone seeking a robot that will thoroughly scrub and sweep their floors. With high-end features at a decent price, the X8\u2019s roller mop, slick navigation, and excellent obstacle avoidance will get the job done.\nBest budget robot vacuum and mop\nMultifunction Dock: No \u2013 just auto empty / Mop style: Vibrating pad / Mop washing: No / Mop pressure: 6N pressure, vibrates 3000 times a minute\u00a0/ Mop lift: Yes, 5mm /\u00a0Edge cleaning: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 6,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Roborock S8 is a great vacuum featuring AI-powered obstacle detection, dual rubber roller brushes, and 6,000Pa of suction. These are all features you won\u2019t find on most budget bots, and combined, they mean the S8 does a good job vacuuming hard floors and carpets. Then, its flat mop, which vibrates 3,000 times a second, is very effective at scrubbing hard floors.\u00a0\nUnlike most robot vacuums in this guide, the S8 won\u2019t automatically fill its water tank or wash its mop; you will have to do that work manually. However, it does have an extra-large onboard water tank, again a feature you won\u2019t find on cheaper mopping bots, which means the mop gets sufficiently wet to be effective.\nThe S8 wasn\u2019t designed as a budget bot; in fact, it was Roborock\u2019s flagship model in 2023, but buying an older model like this can save you a lot of money while still doing a good job. Once $750 for the robot alone, now you can often find it for well under $500, and that\u2019s with its auto-empty dock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite features of the S8 is that it can be set to mop only, and it does an excellent job, moving in a tighter \u201cZ\u201d pattern and going over the floors twice. It also has a slow option for a more thorough cleaning. I liked to send it out to vacuum everywhere first, then recharge and go out again to mop, which resulted in sparklingly clean floors. It does take a long time, though, and it doesn\u2019t have any edge cleaning options, so it won\u2019t mop as well along baseboards or under low furniture as the more expensive models.\nAnother great feature at this price is carpet sensing \u2014 the S8 can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. However, the mop-raising feature can only clear low-pile rugs, so I had to set no-mopping zones around my plush floor coverings.\nThe S8 requires a fair amount of hands-on time since you have to refill its reservoir manually and wash the mopping pads (you can throw them in the washing machine). But if you\u2019re good with a little more manual labor in exchange for cleaner floors, the S8 is a great option.\nRead more of my Roborock S8 review.\nBest midrange robot vacuum and mop\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2.7L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop pressure: 2.2 lbs at 180 RPM\u00a0/ Mop lift: Yes, 12 mm /\u00a0Edge cleaning: Yes, swinging motion / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni is an excellent mop vacuum hybrid with a full multifunction dock. Unlike the Roborock S8, it can wash its mop, drain, and refill its water tank. It\u2019s also the cheapest model to offer dual spinning mop pads, and it has very good obstacle detection for this price range.\u00a0\nHowever, the X10 has just 8,000Pa suction, no hot water washing, and smaller water tanks. While it has most of the same functions as the top-of-the-line mopping bots, it\u2019s not quite as effective at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of \u201cmidrange.\u201d\nAn edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges, but this is less effective than mop extension found on the more expensive models. With its squarish shape, it gets into corners better than most of the round bots, but its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn\u2019t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eufy performed very well in my mopping tests, eradicating dried stains with its 2.2 pounds of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn\u2019t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky \u2014 a first in this price range.\u00a0\nThe X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.\nRead more of my Eufy X10 review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugs\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: Unknown\u00a0 / Mop lift: Yes, 10.5 mm /\u00a0Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have a lot of fluffy rugs or carpets as well as hard floors, the Dreame X40 Ultra is the best robot vacuum for you. It\u2019s not quite as effective as a mop\u00a0or\u00a0vacuum as the Ecovacs Deebot X8, but it\u2019s better suited for high-pile carpet and rugs because it can automatically drop and reattach its mopping pads during vacuuming, eliminating the risk of getting your rugs wet or stained. The Ecovacs X8 can only raise its mop 10mm, not remove it, so it struggles on high-pile carpets.\nAlong with dropping its pads, the X40 can also extend and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. The X8 can extend to an edge, but won\u2019t get under those low cabinets or furniture. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it.\nHowever, because the X40 features dual spinning mop pads rather than a self-cleaning roller mop, it requires more frequent returns to clean the mops, which means it takes longer to clean your home. The X40\u2019s spinning pads are effective at scrubbing your floors, but I found the X8\u2019s roller mop to be better overall and more consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe X40 can clean its washboard and features AI-powered smart dirt detection, which uses its cameras to identify spills, such as milk, or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it slows down and performs a more thorough cleaning. It also has an option to just mop. These are features the Ecovacs X8 doesn\u2019t offer.\nDreame recently released the X50 Ultra, which adds 20,000Pa suction power and the ability to climb over higher thresholds. I\u2019m currently testing this model.\nRead more of my Dream X40 Ultra review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floors\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, warm water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 10N, 170 RPM\u00a0/ Mop lift: Yes, 12mm /\u00a0 Edge cleaning: No Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have mostly hardwood floors, the Eufy Omni S1 Pro is an excellent option. With its sleek, high-tech design and a long 11.4-inch roller mop, this product did an excellent job of keeping the hardwood floors of my main living area spotless.\u00a0\nI found the Eufy\u2019s longer roller mop to be slightly more effective than the Deebot X8\u2019s, mopping evenly and getting up more dirt on its first pass. While there is no mop extension of edge mopping, its square shape does help it get into corners, and its dual spinning side brushes help pull in debris.\n\nHowever, its vacuuming prowess is middling; this really is a dedicated mopping robot. With just 8,000Pa suction power and a small rubber brush, it did a decent job of getting up debris, but left several flakes of oatmeal, thanks to its side brushes spinning the debris out beyond the bot\u2019s reach. Its obstacle avoidance is also fairly average; it dodged larger items but struggled with cables.\u00a0\nThe S1\u2019s omni station is quite eye-catching, with a tall, futuristic design, and clear water tanks with glowing lights inside \u2014 although it might be considered an eyesore, depending on your style. Usefully, everything you need to interact with is located at the top, so there\u2019s no need to bend down: a touchscreen display provides controls and the clean and dirty water tanks are easy to remove.\u00a0\nIf you have tile or scraped wood floors, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better at getting into the crevices\nWhile it has a mop lift of 12mm (which is higher than the X8\u2019s), it really struggled on my high-pile carpets, to the point where I had to set keep-out zones around them.\u00a0\nLike the X8, the S1 self-cleans the mop with water jets as it\u2019s working, and you can set how frequently it returns to the base station for a thorough clean with warm water before continuing to mop. It will also dry the mop with hot air, which is effective, if noisy.\n\n\nNeither the X8 nor the S1 have self-cleaning washboards, something Dreame offers. This is where the dock automatically washes the mopping tray in the dock \u2013 Dreame\u2019s uses little wipers that go back and forth. It still needs to be cleaned eventually, but it does help keep the ick at bay for longer.\u00a0\nThe S1 station\u2019s debris filter got grungy fast and required manual cleaning, although this is fairly straightforward. After a month of use, I also had to disassemble the scraper and filter inside the bot, as well as remove the roller mop. This is something you\u2019ll need to do for all mopping bots, but the Eufy\u2019s was the most involved process, requiring me to disassemble multiple parts.\nIn my testing, I found that roller mops are great for most hardwood floors, but if you have lots of tile or scraped wood floors with grooves and nooks and crannies, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better, as these do a better job of getting into crevices such as grout lines.\u00a0\nBest robot vacuum and mop for tile floors\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (4.1L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual triangular spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.6lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm /\u00a0Edge cleaning: Yes, robot swing and fluffer / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut\nNarwal\u2019s latest flagship mopping bot, the Freo Z Ultra, combines everything I loved about the Freo X Ultra, and adds better vacuuming, better object avoidance, an auto-empty dock (a first for Narwal), and a fluffy side brush to polish your baseboards. It also now comes in gray (white robot vacuums are not a good idea, unless you like cleaning your robot vacuum).\nWith its dual, triangular spinning mop pads (the unique shape helps avoid missing spots), the Freo Z is a great choice for homes with lots of hard floors, and especially tile. The oscillating mop pads are slightly better than roller mops at getting into grout lines and other crevices found on natural surfaces. The Freo Z\u2019s downward pressure of 2.6 lbs meant it did a great job of scrubbing up dried-on debris, excelling in my dried ketchup test, even getting the red gunk up from tile grout.\n\n\nLike the Deebot X8, the Freo Z can recognize various floor materials, including tile, hardwood, and marble, and clean in the direction of the flooring, such as along the wood grain. Unlike the X8, it automatically adjusts pressure and \u201cmopping humidity\u201d based on the floor type, using higher humidity on tile floors than on wood floors, which can be impacted by excessive moisture. The Freo Z also self-cleans its station and has a removable tray, making maintenance easier.\nThe Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a bedroom\nVacuuming is much better than the Freo X, with the Z boasting 12,000Pa. While that\u2019s not as high as the X8, the Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a primary bedroom suite where you may have a tile bathroom combined with carpet. \nAs with the X8, the Narwal doesn\u2019t deal well with high-pile rugs, as there\u2019s still only a 12 mm mop lift and no automatic mop removal. However, you can set it to perform one of four actions when it encounters a carpet: sidestep, cross it without cleaning, power boost to clean the carpet more effectively, or regular cleaning.\nThe obstacle detection is vastly improved and very good. A dual camera system allows the bot to not only see objects but uses AI to identify what they are and \u201cdecide\u201d how to clean them. The best use of this I saw in testing is when there was a large puddle of water and it automatically switched to mop-only so as not to suck up liquid.\nSimilarly, Narwal\u2019s dirt detect feature is very good. The bot goes back and forth over a stain or dirty area to ensure it\u2019s clean.\u00a0\n\n\nMy two biggest gripes with the Freo Z are that it uses a lot of water; it doesn\u2019t have an onboard water tank, so it has to return frequently to refill \u2014 and could only clean my 800 square foot area once before I needed to refill the main tank in the dock. By comparison, the X8\u2019s tank only needed refilling after three runs.\u00a0\u00a0\nAdditionally, its app can be frustrating. It\u2019s not easy to navigate, gets hung up between screens, and frequently disconnects from the robot. However, unlike the X8, the Narwal has controls on top of the station to start a clean, and once I had programmed a schedule, I didn\u2019t find myself needing to use the app much at all.\u00a0\nThe fluffy sidebrush feels more of a novelty than a necessity and doesn\u2019t really seem to do much. Also, at this price, it would be nice if the Narwal offered a self-cleaning washboard. However, its washboard is removable, which makes it easier to clean manually.\nBest robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (4L) and drain/refill (two separate devices) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes (during use), hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.2lbs at 300 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 7mm /\u00a0 Edge cleaning: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 6,500Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut, Matter\nThe SwitchBot S10 is a multitasking robot that hooks into your plumbing for a virtually hands-free sweeping and mopping experience. It\u2019s one of the best robot mops I\u2019ve tested, thanks to its self-cleaning roller mop and the fact that I never had to empty or fill its water tanks. These two features meant I could set it and forget it and have clean floors for weeks.\nMy other favorite feature of the S10 is its dual docking system. Its main dock is a charging / auto-empty dock, and there\u2019s a separate battery-powered dock water station that you can put in a different room. This battery-powered dock is what makes the S10 the best plumbing hookup option, as it gives you much more flexibility with placement. Roborock, Dreame, and Narwal also have plumbing hookup docks, but they require power (I\u2019ve not tested either of those yet).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the SwitchBot is a decent vacuum, it\u2019s not the best. Its relatively paltry 6,500Pa of suction power is low compared to the competition, but the bot\u2019s weight did help the rubber roller brush dig into the carpet and get up most of the cat hair.\nS10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats \u2014 which are the bane of most mopping bots\nOther downsides include the AI obstacle avoidance, which isn\u2019t great. The S10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats, its battery life is short, and it lacks high-end features like dirt detection. There is also no edge cleaning function, meaning it didn\u2019t do a great job along baseboards and around furniture.\nSwitchBot recently announced the SwitchBot S20 Pro, slated to launch this summer. The upgrade addresses some of my issues with the S10, including adding an extendable roller mop and side brush to add edge cleaning, as well as 15,000Pa. It also comes with the option of two all-in-one auto-empty base stations: one with a regular water tank you manually refill, or one that can hook into your plumbing. But it will also work with the battery-powered water station. I plan on testing this soon.\nRead my full SwitchBot S10 review.\nHow I test robot vacuums\nI\u2019ve been testing robot vacuums for 6 years and have tested over 60 models. I write The Verge\u2019s Best robot vacuum buying guide and the Best budget robot vacuum guide, and for this guide, I tested 15 different mopping robots.\nTo evaluate the bots, I ran each regularly for at least a week and measured their progress, evaluating how clean the floor stays, how well they navigate, how often I had to refill the tanks, how well the auto-empty function worked, and how easy the app was to use.\nI run them in my kitchen, where I have hardwood floors, and in a large bathroom with a white tile floor \u2014 one that looks filthy just a day after being cleaned. For specific tests, I deploy a wet and dry challenge. The wet challenge features dried-on OJ and ketchup, plus fresh spills of milk, water, and some kind of sauce. For the dry challenge, I place cereal (usually Cheerios) and oatmeal (a really tough one to clean). I evaluate how well the bots deal with mopping the stains and vacuuming the debris.Finally, I test their obstacle detection by running them through an obstacle course featuring common robot trip-ups, including fake dog poop, cables, socks, and tricky chair legs.\nWhat I\u2019m currently testing and what\u2019s coming next\n\n\nRoborock\u2019s Saros 10 ($1,599.99) and Saros 10R ($1,599.99) are upgrades to my pick for the best overall robot vacuum, the\u00a0S8 MaxV Ultra. Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed, which is a new option for Roborock. One uses dual spinning mops, the other a flat vibrating pad.\nRoborock also\u00a0recently announced\u00a0the $2,599 Saros Z70, the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up objects like socks and tissues. It has dual spinning mop pads that it can automatically remove. Roborock\u2019s cheaper\u00a0Qrevo Curv\u00a0($1,599.99) also has dual spinning mop pads (which you have to remove) and can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The company\u2019s $1,399.99 Qrevo Slim offers similar functions but features a new navigation system and lacks a lidar tower, allowing it to fit under low furniture.\niRobot\u2019s new Roomba lineup features two models with dual spinning mopping pads and auto-wash docks. The new Roomba 505 also offers heated mop drying, a feature\u00a0the higher-end Roomba Combo 10 Max\u00a0lacks.\nThe Narwal Flow sports the brand\u2019s first roller mop, which can also extend. It claims to be able to tackle thick, fluffy carpets with a deep carpet boost mode and is scheduled to arrive this June.\nThe Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum\u00a0that doesn\u2019t need a cloud connection to work and can suck up wet spills as well as dry.\u00a0Here\u2019s some video of it in action.\nEureka\u2019s $1,099.99 J20 features a very wide roller mop but only 8,000Pa suction. The new J15 Max Ultra ($1,299), coming this spring, can accurately spot liquids and automatically rotate its body to tackle wet spills with its dual spinning mopping pads. It\u2019s an upgrade to the\u00a0J15 Pro Ultra ($999.99), which can identify colored liquids but not clear or white ones.\nAs mentioned above, Ecovacs recently released a successor to the Deebot X8 Pro Omni, aptly called the X9 Pro Omni ($1,599.99 $1,299.99). It sports a roller mop like the X8 Pro, but the big difference is that the new model is designed to optimize airflow from intake to exhaust rather than relying solely on suction power. The upgrade could lead to better deep-cleaning, though we haven\u2019t put it through its paces yet.\nThe Dreame X50 Ultra ($1,699.99) features a \u201cmotorized swing arm\u201d\u00a0that functions like a leg, enabling the robovac to climb over transitions up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it\u2019s a lot like the X40 Ultra in this guide, only with higher suction power and a retractable lidar tower.\nThe\u00a0Switchbot S20 Pro\u00a0is the successor to\u00a0the S10 and scheduled to launch this summer. It features an extendable roller mop and side brush, as well as 15,000Pa of suction power, more than twice that of the S10.\nSharkNinja\u2019s\u00a0PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1\u00a0robot vacuum mop ($999.99) can lift itself up as high as 20mm to get over rugs and transitions.

    "content": "\n\n\n\nRobot vacuums that can both mop and sweep your floors have improved significantly in recent years. While they are still not as effective as good ol\u2019 manual labor, if you run them regularly, they will help keep your floors cleaner with much less effort on your part.\nThe difference is that newer \u201ccombo\u201d robot vacuum and mop models are designed to actually scrub your floors. The first robot vacuums that could also \u201cmop\u201d simply slapped a thin, flat microfiber pad on the bot that kind of Swiffer-ed your floor. Basically, all this was good for was getting up fine dirt that the vacuum left behind.\nA robot vacuum with a real mopping system will make your life easier\u00a0\nNewer models now come with vibrating or oscillating mop pads, and some even have roller mops. Most models have onboard water tanks to keep the mops wet while in use, and many can wash and dry their mops in their charging docks, which also automatically empty and refill their water tanks, meaning less work for you.\nWhile most robot vacuums today come with some sort of mopping feature, this guide focuses on those that excel at mopping. If you\u2019re more interested in the best vacuum, check out my guide to floor sweeping bots. \nThe downside to these combo bots with serious mopping chops is that they tend to be bigger and heavier and need more frequent intervention than regular vacuum bots. Water equals gunk, and cleaning their giant multifunction docks, even the self-cleaning ones, can be an icky job. You also have to empty and refill their tanks about once a week.\u00a0\nMopping bots also need to return to their docks more frequently than robot vacuums in order to refill their onboard water tanks. This means they\u2019ll take longer to clean your floors than a dedicated vacuuming model, but they are doing two jobs at once. Robot mops with roller mops will self-clean as they work, negating this issue, but these models are also the largest and bulkiest, as they carry a bigger water tank on board.\u00a0\nCombo bots can mop and vacuum simultaneously, but for especially dirty floors, it\u2019s best to have the option to vacuum first and then mop. A mop-only mode is also good, as you can send the bot to clean up a wet spill without it sucking up water \u2014 something they\u2019re not designed to do, yet.\nIf you have a lot of hardwood or tile floors and constantly struggle with muddy paw prints or the general dirtiness of life with multiple pets, people, and kids, a good robot vacuum and mop combo will definitely make your life easier.\u00a0\n\n\nBest robot vacuum and mopBest budget robot vacuum and mopBest midrange robot vacuum and mopBest robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugsBest robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floorsBest robot vacuum and mop for tile floorsBest robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookupHow I test robot vacuumsWhat I\u2019m currently testing and what\u2019s coming next\n\n\n\nA multifunction charging dock\nThis is a charging base that empties the robot\u2019s bin, washes and dries the bot\u2019s mops, and empties and refills its water tank. This is essential if you want to be as hands-free as possible when mopping your floor. Some offer hot water washing and drying options that will keep your pads cleaner for longer. But you\u2019ll want to throw them in the wash eventually. A dock that can self-clean the washboard (the area where it cleans the mops) is a nice upgrade, as you won\u2019t have to do it yourself as often.\n\n\nBig tanks (or a plumbing hookup)\nThe bigger the clean and dirty water tanks on the dock, the less often you\u2019ll have to refill them. If the dock can connect directly to the plumbing, even better; it\u2019s a more complicated install, but makes for a more hands-off experience long term.\n\n\nBetter mops\nMop type matters. The main options are circular and spinning, flat and vibrating, or rolling and self-cleaning. Rolling (like the beater bar on a vacuum cleaner) is my favorite because it does a better job of getting floors really clean. The greater surface area of a roller mop, combined with the self-cleaning function \u2014 the vac sprays water onto the mop as it runs \u2014 makes it a more effective option than flat or spinning mops in most cases. However, oscillating mops that can extend outwards are better at getting into grout between tiles, along baseboards, and under low furniture.\u00a0\n\n\nMops that lift or drop\nIf you have low-pile rugs and carpet, mop pads that the robot can lift up (by at least 10 mm) should prevent your carpets from getting damp when the robot rolls over them. However, robots that can remove the mop pads entirely before vacuuming carpets are a good option, especially if you have high-pile rugs.\n\n\nDecent mop pressure and speed\nSpecs around mop pressure and rotation speed are similar to those for suction power on the vacuum; they matter to some extent, but what\u2019s more important is how effective the pads are. The higher the pressure, the more effective it should be on tougher stains. The higher the rotations per minute (RPMs), the more friction the stain has to deal with. It\u2019s hard to judge pressure, as several manufacturers don\u2019t list it and those that do use different measurements, but 12 Newtons, roughly 2.2 pounds of downward pressure, is very good.\n\n\nA usable app\nA well-laid-out app is key. It should let you choose which rooms to clean, and in what order. Generally, you want a mopping bot to clean the dirtiest room last (think bathroom or hallway) to avoid cross-contamination. I also look for the option to mop only, in addition to mop and vacuum, or vacuum then mop, and, of course, vacuum only.\n\n\nBest robot vacuum and mop\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 4,000Pa at 200 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 10mm /\u00a0 Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 18,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber/bristle / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Matter support promised\nEcovacs\u2019 Deebot X8 Pro Omni is a welcome return to form for Ecovacs\u2019 flagship line. Its new tower-less lidar navigation system did a much better job of mapping and navigating than the previous flagship, the Deebot X2 Omni, which was constantly getting lost in my tests. However, the most notable thing about the X8 is the Ozmo Roller Mop.\u00a0\nThis is the best roller mopping bot I\u2019ve tested, thanks mostly to the Ozmo\u2019s ability to extend outwards to clean along baseboards and furniture. This is a unique feature on a roller mop (for now) that makes up for the mop\u2019s relatively short length (both the Eufy S1 and Switchbot S10 have longer roller mops).\u00a0At $1,299, the X8 is also one of the less expensive flagship models (though the new X9 Pro Omni retails for $1599.99).\n\n\nThe X8 did an excellent job on my milk, OJ, and dried ketchup tests, absorbing the small spills with one or two passes. It covered the floors evenly, without leaving any streaks or gaps, something that I\u2019ve seen happen with spinning mop pads. When it comes across an edge \u2014 be it a baseboard, furniture like a chair or table leg, or any obstacle \u2014 it extends out its mop to the right to clean as close as possible. It did an excellent job getting the grime up from the stools around my kitchen counter, something most other bots struggle to do.\nThis is the best roller mopping bot I\u2019ve tested\nThe self-cleaning brush system kept the bot from smearing any spills it encountered. As it\u2019s cleaning, a scraper squeegees off the dirty water and 16 nozzles spray it with fresh water and solution, if you use it. As with most high-end mopping bots, the dock has the option of auto-dispensing cleaning solution.\nThe X8 was the best vacuuming robot among the serious combo bots I tested, outperforming my Cheerio and oatmeal tests and doing a good job on rugs (when it could reach them). However, its vacuum has a relatively small, single rubber roller brush, which is less effective than Roborock\u2019s and Roomba\u2019s dual roller brush models (which include the S8 MaxV Ultra and the 10 Max).\n\n\nThe X8 uses lidar and a 3D camera for mapping; the latter also facilitates its obstacle detection, which is very good \u2014 it easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios. It\u2019s much better at navigating than the X2, but it did occasionally get itself trapped, including when it went under a chair that was too low for it to get out from. The top of the robot was fairly scratched up after just one week of use. (Worth noting, Ecovacs suffered a hack last year in which bad actors could access the camera and microphone on the X2)\nThe X8\u2019s multifunction dock is much smaller than the X2\u2019s and has some nice rose gold accents. Its water tanks are integrated into the dock and supereasy to remove to empty and refill \u2014 there\u2019s no lid to mess with, you just lift up and go. The X8 doesn\u2019t self-clean its washboard, however, and while it\u2019s removable to make it easier to clean, I still had to get on my knees and scrub its base station after just a week of use.\nIt easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios\nThe downside of roller mop bots is that they are big and heavy: the X8 weighs a whopping 12 pounds. Despite an ability to lift itself up to clear thresholds, the X8 isn\u2019t as agile as smaller, lighter robot vacs. It struggled with the combo challenge of a large, tasseled, high-pile rug and spindly chair leg. Very few robot vacs tackle that one well, but it got stuck on the chair leg and sucked up the rug tassels. I ended up setting a keep-out zone so it could complete its job.\nThe integrated nature of the roller mop means the bot can\u2019t remove it when it goes to vacuum carpet, as some mopping bots with pads can. It can lift it, but only 10mm, which isn\u2019t going to work for the fluffiest rugs. The X8 does have carpet sensors, and you can choose to avoid them automatically, pass over them, or vacuum only. But its best carpet feature is the option to have it vacuum the carpets first, then mop everywhere else.\u00a0\nOverall, the Deebot X8 is a stellar vacuum mop combo for anyone seeking a robot that will thoroughly scrub and sweep their floors. With high-end features at a decent price, the X8\u2019s roller mop, slick navigation, and excellent obstacle avoidance will get the job done.\nBest budget robot vacuum and mop\nMultifunction Dock: No \u2013 just auto empty / Mop style: Vibrating pad / Mop washing: No / Mop pressure: 6N pressure, vibrates 3000 times a minute\u00a0/ Mop lift: Yes, 5mm /\u00a0Edge cleaning: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 6,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Roborock S8 is a great vacuum featuring AI-powered obstacle detection, dual rubber roller brushes, and 6,000Pa of suction. These are all features you won\u2019t find on most budget bots, and combined, they mean the S8 does a good job vacuuming hard floors and carpets. Then, its flat mop, which vibrates 3,000 times a second, is very effective at scrubbing hard floors.\u00a0\nUnlike most robot vacuums in this guide, the S8 won\u2019t automatically fill its water tank or wash its mop; you will have to do that work manually. However, it does have an extra-large onboard water tank, again a feature you won\u2019t find on cheaper mopping bots, which means the mop gets sufficiently wet to be effective.\nThe S8 wasn\u2019t designed as a budget bot; in fact, it was Roborock\u2019s flagship model in 2023, but buying an older model like this can save you a lot of money while still doing a good job. Once $750 for the robot alone, now you can often find it for well under $500, and that\u2019s with its auto-empty dock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite features of the S8 is that it can be set to mop only, and it does an excellent job, moving in a tighter \u201cZ\u201d pattern and going over the floors twice. It also has a slow option for a more thorough cleaning. I liked to send it out to vacuum everywhere first, then recharge and go out again to mop, which resulted in sparklingly clean floors. It does take a long time, though, and it doesn\u2019t have any edge cleaning options, so it won\u2019t mop as well along baseboards or under low furniture as the more expensive models.\nAnother great feature at this price is carpet sensing \u2014 the S8 can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. However, the mop-raising feature can only clear low-pile rugs, so I had to set no-mopping zones around my plush floor coverings.\nThe S8 requires a fair amount of hands-on time since you have to refill its reservoir manually and wash the mopping pads (you can throw them in the washing machine). But if you\u2019re good with a little more manual labor in exchange for cleaner floors, the S8 is a great option.\nRead more of my Roborock S8 review.\nBest midrange robot vacuum and mop\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2.7L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop pressure: 2.2 lbs at 180 RPM\u00a0/ Mop lift: Yes, 12 mm /\u00a0Edge cleaning: Yes, swinging motion / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni is an excellent mop vacuum hybrid with a full multifunction dock. Unlike the Roborock S8, it can wash its mop, drain, and refill its water tank. It\u2019s also the cheapest model to offer dual spinning mop pads, and it has very good obstacle detection for this price range.\u00a0\nHowever, the X10 has just 8,000Pa suction, no hot water washing, and smaller water tanks. While it has most of the same functions as the top-of-the-line mopping bots, it\u2019s not quite as effective at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of \u201cmidrange.\u201d\nAn edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges, but this is less effective than mop extension found on the more expensive models. With its squarish shape, it gets into corners better than most of the round bots, but its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn\u2019t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eufy performed very well in my mopping tests, eradicating dried stains with its 2.2 pounds of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn\u2019t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky \u2014 a first in this price range.\u00a0\nThe X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.\nRead more of my Eufy X10 review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugs\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: Unknown\u00a0 / Mop lift: Yes, 10.5 mm /\u00a0Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have a lot of fluffy rugs or carpets as well as hard floors, the Dreame X40 Ultra is the best robot vacuum for you. It\u2019s not quite as effective as a mop\u00a0or\u00a0vacuum as the Ecovacs Deebot X8, but it\u2019s better suited for high-pile carpet and rugs because it can automatically drop and reattach its mopping pads during vacuuming, eliminating the risk of getting your rugs wet or stained. The Ecovacs X8 can only raise its mop 10mm, not remove it, so it struggles on high-pile carpets.\nAlong with dropping its pads, the X40 can also extend and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. The X8 can extend to an edge, but won\u2019t get under those low cabinets or furniture. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it.\nHowever, because the X40 features dual spinning mop pads rather than a self-cleaning roller mop, it requires more frequent returns to clean the mops, which means it takes longer to clean your home. The X40\u2019s spinning pads are effective at scrubbing your floors, but I found the X8\u2019s roller mop to be better overall and more consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe X40 can clean its washboard and features AI-powered smart dirt detection, which uses its cameras to identify spills, such as milk, or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it slows down and performs a more thorough cleaning. It also has an option to just mop. These are features the Ecovacs X8 doesn\u2019t offer.\nDreame recently released the X50 Ultra, which adds 20,000Pa suction power and the ability to climb over higher thresholds. I\u2019m currently testing this model.\nRead more of my Dream X40 Ultra review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floors\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, warm water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 10N, 170 RPM\u00a0/ Mop lift: Yes, 12mm /\u00a0 Edge cleaning: No Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have mostly hardwood floors, the Eufy Omni S1 Pro is an excellent option. With its sleek, high-tech design and a long 11.4-inch roller mop, this product did an excellent job of keeping the hardwood floors of my main living area spotless.\u00a0\nI found the Eufy\u2019s longer roller mop to be slightly more effective than the Deebot X8\u2019s, mopping evenly and getting up more dirt on its first pass. While there is no mop extension of edge mopping, its square shape does help it get into corners, and its dual spinning side brushes help pull in debris.\n\nHowever, its vacuuming prowess is middling; this really is a dedicated mopping robot. With just 8,000Pa suction power and a small rubber brush, it did a decent job of getting up debris, but left several flakes of oatmeal, thanks to its side brushes spinning the debris out beyond the bot\u2019s reach. Its obstacle avoidance is also fairly average; it dodged larger items but struggled with cables.\u00a0\nThe S1\u2019s omni station is quite eye-catching, with a tall, futuristic design, and clear water tanks with glowing lights inside \u2014 although it might be considered an eyesore, depending on your style. Usefully, everything you need to interact with is located at the top, so there\u2019s no need to bend down: a touchscreen display provides controls and the clean and dirty water tanks are easy to remove.\u00a0\nIf you have tile or scraped wood floors, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better at getting into the crevices\nWhile it has a mop lift of 12mm (which is higher than the X8\u2019s), it really struggled on my high-pile carpets, to the point where I had to set keep-out zones around them.\u00a0\nLike the X8, the S1 self-cleans the mop with water jets as it\u2019s working, and you can set how frequently it returns to the base station for a thorough clean with warm water before continuing to mop. It will also dry the mop with hot air, which is effective, if noisy.\n\n\nNeither the X8 nor the S1 have self-cleaning washboards, something Dreame offers. This is where the dock automatically washes the mopping tray in the dock \u2013 Dreame\u2019s uses little wipers that go back and forth. It still needs to be cleaned eventually, but it does help keep the ick at bay for longer.\u00a0\nThe S1 station\u2019s debris filter got grungy fast and required manual cleaning, although this is fairly straightforward. After a month of use, I also had to disassemble the scraper and filter inside the bot, as well as remove the roller mop. This is something you\u2019ll need to do for all mopping bots, but the Eufy\u2019s was the most involved process, requiring me to disassemble multiple parts.\nIn my testing, I found that roller mops are great for most hardwood floors, but if you have lots of tile or scraped wood floors with grooves and nooks and crannies, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better, as these do a better job of getting into crevices such as grout lines.\u00a0\nBest robot vacuum and mop for tile floors\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (4.1L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual triangular spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.6lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm /\u00a0Edge cleaning: Yes, robot swing and fluffer / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut\nNarwal\u2019s latest flagship mopping bot, the Freo Z Ultra, combines everything I loved about the Freo X Ultra, and adds better vacuuming, better object avoidance, an auto-empty dock (a first for Narwal), and a fluffy side brush to polish your baseboards. It also now comes in gray (white robot vacuums are not a good idea, unless you like cleaning your robot vacuum).\nWith its dual, triangular spinning mop pads (the unique shape helps avoid missing spots), the Freo Z is a great choice for homes with lots of hard floors, and especially tile. The oscillating mop pads are slightly better than roller mops at getting into grout lines and other crevices found on natural surfaces. The Freo Z\u2019s downward pressure of 2.6 lbs meant it did a great job of scrubbing up dried-on debris, excelling in my dried ketchup test, even getting the red gunk up from tile grout.\n\n\nLike the Deebot X8, the Freo Z can recognize various floor materials, including tile, hardwood, and marble, and clean in the direction of the flooring, such as along the wood grain. Unlike the X8, it automatically adjusts pressure and \u201cmopping humidity\u201d based on the floor type, using higher humidity on tile floors than on wood floors, which can be impacted by excessive moisture. The Freo Z also self-cleans its station and has a removable tray, making maintenance easier.\nThe Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a bedroom\nVacuuming is much better than the Freo X, with the Z boasting 12,000Pa. While that\u2019s not as high as the X8, the Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a primary bedroom suite where you may have a tile bathroom combined with carpet. \nAs with the X8, the Narwal doesn\u2019t deal well with high-pile rugs, as there\u2019s still only a 12 mm mop lift and no automatic mop removal. However, you can set it to perform one of four actions when it encounters a carpet: sidestep, cross it without cleaning, power boost to clean the carpet more effectively, or regular cleaning.\nThe obstacle detection is vastly improved and very good. A dual camera system allows the bot to not only see objects but uses AI to identify what they are and \u201cdecide\u201d how to clean them. The best use of this I saw in testing is when there was a large puddle of water and it automatically switched to mop-only so as not to suck up liquid.\nSimilarly, Narwal\u2019s dirt detect feature is very good. The bot goes back and forth over a stain or dirty area to ensure it\u2019s clean.\u00a0\n\n\nMy two biggest gripes with the Freo Z are that it uses a lot of water; it doesn\u2019t have an onboard water tank, so it has to return frequently to refill \u2014 and could only clean my 800 square foot area once before I needed to refill the main tank in the dock. By comparison, the X8\u2019s tank only needed refilling after three runs.\u00a0\u00a0\nAdditionally, its app can be frustrating. It\u2019s not easy to navigate, gets hung up between screens, and frequently disconnects from the robot. However, unlike the X8, the Narwal has controls on top of the station to start a clean, and once I had programmed a schedule, I didn\u2019t find myself needing to use the app much at all.\u00a0\nThe fluffy sidebrush feels more of a novelty than a necessity and doesn\u2019t really seem to do much. Also, at this price, it would be nice if the Narwal offered a self-cleaning washboard. However, its washboard is removable, which makes it easier to clean manually.\nBest robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (4L) and drain/refill (two separate devices) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes (during use), hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.2lbs at 300 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 7mm /\u00a0 Edge cleaning: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 6,500Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut, Matter\nThe SwitchBot S10 is a multitasking robot that hooks into your plumbing for a virtually hands-free sweeping and mopping experience. It\u2019s one of the best robot mops I\u2019ve tested, thanks to its self-cleaning roller mop and the fact that I never had to empty or fill its water tanks. These two features meant I could set it and forget it and have clean floors for weeks.\nMy other favorite feature of the S10 is its dual docking system. Its main dock is a charging / auto-empty dock, and there\u2019s a separate battery-powered dock water station that you can put in a different room. This battery-powered dock is what makes the S10 the best plumbing hookup option, as it gives you much more flexibility with placement. Roborock, Dreame, and Narwal also have plumbing hookup docks, but they require power (I\u2019ve not tested either of those yet).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the SwitchBot is a decent vacuum, it\u2019s not the best. Its relatively paltry 6,500Pa of suction power is low compared to the competition, but the bot\u2019s weight did help the rubber roller brush dig into the carpet and get up most of the cat hair.\nS10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats \u2014 which are the bane of most mopping bots\nOther downsides include the AI obstacle avoidance, which isn\u2019t great. The S10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats, its battery life is short, and it lacks high-end features like dirt detection. There is also no edge cleaning function, meaning it didn\u2019t do a great job along baseboards and around furniture.\nSwitchBot recently announced the SwitchBot S20 Pro, slated to launch this summer. The upgrade addresses some of my issues with the S10, including adding an extendable roller mop and side brush to add edge cleaning, as well as 15,000Pa. It also comes with the option of two all-in-one auto-empty base stations: one with a regular water tank you manually refill, or one that can hook into your plumbing. But it will also work with the battery-powered water station. I plan on testing this soon.\nRead my full SwitchBot S10 review.\nHow I test robot vacuums\nI\u2019ve been testing robot vacuums for 6 years and have tested over 60 models. I write The Verge\u2019s Best robot vacuum buying guide and the Best budget robot vacuum guide, and for this guide, I tested 15 different mopping robots.\nTo evaluate the bots, I ran each regularly for at least a week and measured their progress, evaluating how clean the floor stays, how well they navigate, how often I had to refill the tanks, how well the auto-empty function worked, and how easy the app was to use.\nI run them in my kitchen, where I have hardwood floors, and in a large bathroom with a white tile floor \u2014 one that looks filthy just a day after being cleaned. For specific tests, I deploy a wet and dry challenge. The wet challenge features dried-on OJ and ketchup, plus fresh spills of milk, water, and some kind of sauce. For the dry challenge, I place cereal (usually Cheerios) and oatmeal (a really tough one to clean). I evaluate how well the bots deal with mopping the stains and vacuuming the debris.Finally, I test their obstacle detection by running them through an obstacle course featuring common robot trip-ups, including fake dog poop, cables, socks, and tricky chair legs.\nWhat I\u2019m currently testing and what\u2019s coming next\n\n\nRoborock\u2019s Saros 10 ($1,599.99) and Saros 10R ($1,599.99) are upgrades to my pick for the best overall robot vacuum, the\u00a0S8 MaxV Ultra. Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed, which is a new option for Roborock. One uses dual spinning mops, the other a flat vibrating pad.\nRoborock also\u00a0recently announced\u00a0the $2,599 Saros Z70, the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up objects like socks and tissues. It has dual spinning mop pads that it can automatically remove. Roborock\u2019s cheaper\u00a0Qrevo Curv\u00a0($1,599.99) also has dual spinning mop pads (which you have to remove) and can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The company\u2019s $1,399.99 Qrevo Slim offers similar functions but features a new navigation system and lacks a lidar tower, allowing it to fit under low furniture.\niRobot\u2019s new Roomba lineup features two models with dual spinning mopping pads and auto-wash docks. The new Roomba 505 also offers heated mop drying, a feature\u00a0the higher-end Roomba Combo 10 Max\u00a0lacks.\nThe Narwal Flow sports the brand\u2019s first roller mop, which can also extend. It claims to be able to tackle thick, fluffy carpets with a deep carpet boost mode and is scheduled to arrive this June.\nThe Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum\u00a0that doesn\u2019t need a cloud connection to work and can suck up wet spills as well as dry.\u00a0Here\u2019s some video of it in action.\nEureka\u2019s $1,099.99 J20 features a very wide roller mop but only 8,000Pa suction. The new J15 Max Ultra ($1,299), coming this spring, can accurately spot liquids and automatically rotate its body to tackle wet spills with its dual spinning mopping pads. It\u2019s an upgrade to the\u00a0J15 Pro Ultra ($999.99), which can identify colored liquids but not clear or white ones.\nAs mentioned above, Ecovacs recently released a successor to the Deebot X8 Pro Omni, aptly called the X9 Pro Omni ($1,599.99 $1,299.99). It sports a roller mop like the X8 Pro, but the big difference is that the new model is designed to optimize airflow from intake to exhaust rather than relying solely on suction power. The upgrade could lead to better deep-cleaning, though we haven\u2019t put it through its paces yet.\nThe Dreame X50 Ultra ($1,699.99) features a \u201cmotorized swing arm\u201d\u00a0that functions like a leg, enabling the robovac to climb over transitions up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it\u2019s a lot like the X40 Ultra in this guide, only with higher suction power and a retractable lidar tower.\nThe\u00a0Switchbot S20 Pro\u00a0is the successor to\u00a0the S10 and scheduled to launch this summer. It features an extendable roller mop and side brush, as well as 15,000Pa of suction power, more than twice that of the S10.\nSharkNinja\u2019s\u00a0PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1\u00a0robot vacuum mop ($999.99) can lift itself up as high as 20mm to get over rugs and transitions. Its automatic empty /wash / dry cleaning station doesn\u2019t require bags.\nPriced at $999.99, Eufy\u2019s new Robot Vacuum Omni E28 is a self-emptying, self-refilling, and self-washing robot vacuum with a rolling mop that can go over tough stains a second time if needed. The charging dock also includes a built-in deep cleaner that sprays water to tackle stains before sucking the mess into a separate wastewater tank.\n\nPhotography by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, May 13th: Added Eufy\u2019s Robot Vacuum Omni E28, mentioned the Ecovacs X9 Pro Omni, and adjusted prices / availability.
