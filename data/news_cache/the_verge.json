Today, the EPA announced an about-face. The agency now wants to exclude several types of the chemicals from the rule, including so-called GenX substances initially intended to replace older versions of forever chemicals but that ended up creating new concerns. It also proposed extending compliance deadlines for the two most prevalent forms of forever chemicals, and says it\u2019ll establish a \u201cframework\u201d for more exemptions.\nHealth and environmental advocates slammed the proposed exclusions and enforcement delays as a threat to Americans. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a shameful and dangerous capitulation to industry pressure that will allow continued contamination of our drinking water,\u201d Mary Grant, water program director at the nonprofit Food & Water Watch said in a press statement. \u201cThis will cost lives.\u201d\n\u201cA shameful and dangerous capitulation to industry pressure\u201d\nThere are thousands of different types of forever chemicals, also known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Companies have used them for decades to make products such as nonstick pans, food packaging, and fabric protector water, stain, and heat-resistant. As a result, forever chemicals are estimated to have trickled into at least 45 percent of the nation\u2019s tap water and are present in most Americans\u2019 blood streams.\nThe Biden-era standards set limits for just five widely used types of chemicals: PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS, and HFPO-DA (also known as \u201cGenX Chemicals\u201d), plus mixtures of several chemicals, including perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), found in floor wax, carpeting, and carpet cleaners.\u00a0\nSome manufacturers have already pledged to stop using PFAS after facing a slew of lawsuits. The company 3M agreed to a $450 million settlement with the state of New Jersey on Tuesday over PFAS pollution.\u00a0\nIn April, the EPA said it would launch new efforts to study the chemicals and consider guidelines to limit pollution from manufacturers. At the time, advocacy groups were wary that the agency might simply delay action by calling for more studies \u2014 especially as the Trump administration attempts to slash the agency\u2019s staff, budget, and research department. Advocates have been pushing for drinking water limits since President Donald Trump\u2019s first term as a growing body of evidence pointed to the health risks.\u00a0\nNow, it\u2019s clear the agency doesn\u2019t want to enforce existing forever chemical rules for drinking water.\u00a0\nThe initial compliance date for those rules was 2029. The EPA now says it only plans to keep limits for PFOA and PFOS, and move the compliance deadline back to 2031 to relieve pressure on small water systems. As their name suggests, forever chemicals are difficult to destroy and the Trump administration says its proposal would save money.\n\u201cThis commonsense decision provides the additional time that water system managers need to identify affordable treatment technologies and make sure they are on a sustainable path to compliance,\u201d National Rural Water Association CEO Matthew Holmes said in the EPA press release.\n\u201cWe are on a path to uphold the agency\u2019s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,\u201d EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a press release.

    "summary": "\n\n\ufeffChoose your foldable fighter.\n\nA foldable phone isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. They\u2019re generally heavier, pricier, and have less capable cameras than a standard slab-style phone. And while they\u2019re far less fragile than when they first debuted, foldables are still susceptible to the kind of damage a regular smartphone can shrug off. You really don\u2019t want any dust getting in that hinge. But if you\u2019re an adventurous sort of gadget lover, then a folding phone is a rewarding investment.\u00a0\nThere are basically two kinds of foldables at the moment \u2014 the kind that fold like books and the ones that fold clamshell style, like your old flip phone. Here\u2019s how I think of it: a book-style foldable is like a phone plus a tablet, and a flip-style foldable is a phone plus a smartwatch. The book foldables provide an outer screen for all your regular phone needs, and then a tablet-like inner screen when you want, well, more screen. Flip phones come with a smaller secondary display on the outer panel that\u2019s useful for checking information quickly. When you need to do regular phone stuff, you unfold it.\n\n\nHow we test phones\nThere\u2019s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life \u2014 stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid \u2014 everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become\u00a0so routine that it\u2019s mostly painless.\n\n\nTop-notch software support\nThe phones listed here have powerful processors and enough RAM to keep up for years, so it\u2019s fair to expect more than a handful of OS updates throughout the life of your phone. Four years of new OS versions and five years of security updates is a healthy benchmark for this class, and many of the phones here meet or exceed that standard.\n\n\nA fantastic camera\nMost phone cameras can perform well in good lighting conditions, from the flagship class down to $300 budget phones. The devices listed here offer a little something extra, like a useful telephoto lens, a great portrait mode, or impressive low-light shooting \u2014 and many include all three. Stabilization for the main camera unit to help in low light is a must in this category.\n\n\nBest-in-class build quality\nAn IPX8 rating has become standard for foldables, meaning they can survive full water immersion. But X stands for \u201cnot dustproof,\u201d and no folding phone maker has figured out how to fully protect these devices from dust yet \u2014 what with the moving parts and all. Devices with an IP48 rating aren\u2019t dustproof either; they\u2019re only rated to withstand solid particles 1mm or bigger, which is larger than dust.\n\n\nValue\nIn addition to the best devices at any price, I look for phones that offer the best mix of must-have features for good prices. That might lead to a recommendation of a lower-tier model if it\u2019s particularly feature-rich for its price or last year\u2019s model if it\u2019s still sold new and this year\u2019s device doesn\u2019t offer many upgrades.\n\n\nSo while they all fit in one category of folding tech, they\u2019re suited to two very different kinds of people \u2014 someone who wants even more phone with their phone and someone who wants to be fully immersed a little less. Whichever category you fit into, you\u2019d be wise to get the manufacturer\u2019s extended warranty with your purchase; fixes can be expensive, and you won\u2019t be able to walk into just any phone repair shop to get them. If you don\u2019t opt for the warranty, you\u2019ll want to be sure you can comfortably afford to replace your phone in the event of a sudden sand-related catastrophe. Death can come swiftly to a folding screen.\nIf I haven\u2019t scared you off by this point, then you\u2019re probably the kind of person who will have a heck of a good time with a foldable. I\u2019ve used every phone under the sun, and folding phones are some of my favorite gadgets. Run four apps at once! Prop it up like a tiny laptop! Hold it like a camcorder when you shoot video! There are tons of possibilities, and the thrill you get when you fold your phone shut never fully wears off.\n\n\nBest book-style foldableBest flip-style foldableThe foldable that\u2019s the most funThe best foldable for multitaskersThe best \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s this thin\u201d foldableOther foldables to considerWhat\u2019s coming next\n\nBest book-style foldable\nScreen: 8-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.3-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 4,650mAh / Charging: 21W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather resistance: IPX8\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold is only Google\u2019s second folding phone, but it\u2019s more refined than you might expect from a sophomore effort.

    "content": "\n\n\ufeffChoose your foldable fighter.\n\nA foldable phone isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. They\u2019re generally heavier, pricier, and have less capable cameras than a standard slab-style phone. And while they\u2019re far less fragile than when they first debuted, foldables are still susceptible to the kind of damage a regular smartphone can shrug off. You really don\u2019t want any dust getting in that hinge. But if you\u2019re an adventurous sort of gadget lover, then a folding phone is a rewarding investment.\u00a0\nThere are basically two kinds of foldables at the moment \u2014 the kind that fold like books and the ones that fold clamshell style, like your old flip phone. Here\u2019s how I think of it: a book-style foldable is like a phone plus a tablet, and a flip-style foldable is a phone plus a smartwatch. The book foldables provide an outer screen for all your regular phone needs, and then a tablet-like inner screen when you want, well, more screen. Flip phones come with a smaller secondary display on the outer panel that\u2019s useful for checking information quickly. When you need to do regular phone stuff, you unfold it.\n\n\nHow we test phones\nThere\u2019s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life \u2014 stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid \u2014 everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become\u00a0so routine that it\u2019s mostly painless.\n\n\nTop-notch software support\nThe phones listed here have powerful processors and enough RAM to keep up for years, so it\u2019s fair to expect more than a handful of OS updates throughout the life of your phone. Four years of new OS versions and five years of security updates is a healthy benchmark for this class, and many of the phones here meet or exceed that standard.\n\n\nA fantastic camera\nMost phone cameras can perform well in good lighting conditions, from the flagship class down to $300 budget phones. The devices listed here offer a little something extra, like a useful telephoto lens, a great portrait mode, or impressive low-light shooting \u2014 and many include all three. Stabilization for the main camera unit to help in low light is a must in this category.\n\n\nBest-in-class build quality\nAn IPX8 rating has become standard for foldables, meaning they can survive full water immersion. But X stands for \u201cnot dustproof,\u201d and no folding phone maker has figured out how to fully protect these devices from dust yet \u2014 what with the moving parts and all. Devices with an IP48 rating aren\u2019t dustproof either; they\u2019re only rated to withstand solid particles 1mm or bigger, which is larger than dust.\n\n\nValue\nIn addition to the best devices at any price, I look for phones that offer the best mix of must-have features for good prices. That might lead to a recommendation of a lower-tier model if it\u2019s particularly feature-rich for its price or last year\u2019s model if it\u2019s still sold new and this year\u2019s device doesn\u2019t offer many upgrades.\n\n\nSo while they all fit in one category of folding tech, they\u2019re suited to two very different kinds of people \u2014 someone who wants even more phone with their phone and someone who wants to be fully immersed a little less.

The \u201ctrifold\u201d phone \u2014 as it\u2019s been dubbed \u2014 contains three screen segments and two hinges, putting it in a category of its own right now. It\u2019s only available in China and a few other countries that don\u2019t include the US or the UK, and it\u2019s monstrously expensive at \u20ac3,499. But it\u2019s cool as heck and may be a sign of things to come from other manufacturers.\n\nWhat\u2019s coming next\n\nRazr has a trio of new foldables coming down the pipe \u2014 including a new high-end Razr Ultra that comes with a\u00a0real wood back panel, a larger 7-inch inner screen, and a sky-high price tag of $1,299. All three phones, including lower-end Razr ($699) and Razr Plus ($999), will showcase a host of quality-of-life improvements when they launch on May 15th, too, including a sturdier hinge, IP48 water resistance, and several surprisingly promising AI features.\n\nUpdate, May 14th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability, along with the impending release of Razr\u2019s latest batch of foldable phones."
