    "summary": "\n\nWith access to Gemini-powered features on Nest Cams like this one, app developers could tap into more advanced automations.\n\nGoogle is bringing Gemini intelligence to its Home APIs, allowing smart home developers and manufacturers to tap into Gemini\u2019s AI-powered features and potentially making your smart home a lot, well, smarter. The company announced the news in a blog post during the Google I/O developers conference this week.\nLast summer, Google added several new Gemini-powered capabilities to its own platform, and now it\u2019s extending those to others. This includes access to AI-powered camera analytics from Google Nest cameras and creating smart home routines using conversational language. \nThe company also announced new triggers for automations, including date and weather. Developers with access to the APIs will be able to pull these features into their apps, meaning that, as a user, you might experience them without ever opening the Google Home app.\nFor example, access to the AI-generated descriptions and search capabilities of Nest cameras could allow a company like ADT (which is already using Google Home APIs) to bring these features into its own home security app. So a user could ask questions like, \u201cDid the kids leave their bikes in the driveway?\u201d In addition to the AI features, developers can also pull livestreaming, event history, two-way talk, and camera settings for Google\u2019s Nest cameras into their apps.\u00a0\n\nWith Gemini in Home APIs, developers can allow users to set up smart home automations and routines within their apps with conversational language; they can just say what they want to do. Gemini can also proactively suggest automations by analyzing the devices in a user\u2019s home, according to Google. \nAll of this should enable companies to offer more advanced smart home control within their own apps, potentially eliminating some of the more complicated and confusing setup processes and allowing users to get more out of their smart home devices without spending lots of time manually configuring them.\u00a0\n\nGoogle originally launched its Home APIs at I/O last year as a way for developers to tap into Google Home-compatible devices and automations. This includes any devices connected through Matter, which boosts the number of devices Google Home can control to over 750 million, according to the blog post.\u00a0\nSome companies, including ADT, Yale, and Eve, got early access to those APIs. Another, First Alert, recently launched a smart smoke alarm that uses Home APIs to interconnect with Google\u2019s Nest Protect smoke alarm. Google has stopped manufacturing the Protect, but as it can continue to work for at least 10 years, the First Alert device could help homeowners maintain interconnected smoke alarms as they upgrade their system.\n\nThis week, Google announced that smart lighting manufacturer Cync is integrating Google Home APIs, allowing users to control any device they have synced to Google Home in the Cync app. Smart home platform\u00a0Tuya Smart\u00a0is also working with the APIs, and Google said iRobot is leveraging the APIs to integrate Google\u2019s Home and Away feature into its app. This would allow select Roomba vacuums to automatically start cleaning when you leave home \u2014 an option Roombas have had with Amazon Alexa for a while.\u00a0\nDevelopers who use the Home APIs will be able to control those devices and experiences through the Gemini smartphone app and Nest smart speakers, with support for smart displays, Google TV, and the\u00a0Pixel Tablet coming later this year, according to Google. They also teased a new Home Summary widget for the\u00a0Pixel Tablet.\n\nMost of those devices are controllable by voice, and while Google Assistant has been officially retired on smartphones in favor of Gemini, it\u2019s still around on smart speakers and displays. However, the company has begun rolling out a \u201cnew experience\u201d powered by Gemini to its Nest Audio and Nest Mini 1st and 2nd-gen speakers for users in its Public Preview program who have a Nest Aware subscription. It sounds like the rest of the hardware lineup won\u2019t be far behind. \nBut don\u2019t expect to see these new Gemini-powered features in loads of third-party apps soon. According to Google, the Gemini in Home APIs will be available via an early access program \u201cto a small group of partners\u201d later this year.\u00a0",

It\u2019s powered by 2023\u2019s Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, and boasts a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen, IP68 and 69 ratings, and sizable 5,300mAh battery (with an even larger 6,000mAh cell outside Europe). The triple camera is impressive too, with a 200-megapixel main shooter, plus an ultrawide and telephoto.\nI\u2019m a bigger fan of the regular 400 though, and not just because at \u00a3399.99 / \u20ac499 (around $560) it\u2019s substantially cheaper. It has straight sides, rather than the curved edges of the Pro model, and combined with a smaller 6.5-inch display it\u2019s much more comfortable to use.\nThe 400 ships with the same main and ultrawide cameras as the Pro, only giving up on the telephoto. Its IP65 water-resistance is a little less comprehensive, and the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 won\u2019t offer quite as much power, but the combination of the same large battery and a smaller screen should give this great endurance.

That matches Samsung\u2019s promise for its Galaxy A56, and falls just one year short of the seven years guaranteed for the Pixel 9A. Both 400 phones arrive running Honor\u2019s MagicOS and Android 15, and include a unique AI image-to-video feature powered by Google\u2019s Veo 2 model, currently not available on any other phones.\nWhile I\u2019m not entirely sold on the 400 Pro\u2019s near-flagship price tag, the base 400 looks like a compelling alternative to the Pixel 9A and Galaxy A56.

    "summary": "\n\n\n\nToday, I\u2019m talking with Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. We recorded this conversation the day Uber announced a big set of product updates, including new options for shared rides and some features to make commuting easier and more predictable. Dara was in New York for all that, so he came to our studio, and we did this one together, which always makes for a great episode.\nAs it happens, the traffic in New York that day was truly terrible \u2014 so we started by talking about how often Dara actually takes an Uber, what that\u2019s like for him, and what it\u2019s like when he goes and serves as an Uber driver, something he does regularly. There\u2019s a lot of security around an Uber Eats delivery when Dara\u2019s behind the wheel, it turns out.\n\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems.\u00a0Subscribe\u00a0here!\n\nUber might be the single best example of the major service apps that boomed into existence in the early part of the smartphone era. In the simplest terms, I think of it as the button that can make a Toyota Camry appear nearly anywhere in the world. But underneath that simple idea is a complicated dance with tons of dependencies. Since he took over for founder Travis Kalanick almost a decade ago, it\u2019s been Dara\u2019s job to really operationalize and smooth the company out into a stable, profitable organization.\nThat\u2019s Decoder bait through and through, so we spent a lot of time deep in how Dara thinks about Uber\u2019s various businesses, how they\u2019re split between product functions and the regional teams in all the countries that Uber operates in, and how Uber plans to grow as things like Waymo and other autonomous vehicle companies enter the picture.\nLike so many mature service companies, a big part of the answer is to try and become a consistent part in people\u2019s lives that drives recurring revenue \u2013 that\u2019s things like Uber One subscriptions, but also bulk trip discounts for regular commuters. And Uber\u2019s biggest news last week was something it called Route Share: predetermined spots where an Uber is guaranteed to come every 20 minutes and pick you up.\nYes, I asked Dara if Uber had just reinvented the bus. His answer is that Uber should be a complement to great public transit, and we talked a little about congestion pricing in New York and how that\u2019s playing out in the data that Uber can see.\nIf you\u2019ve been listening to Decoder recently, you know that I\u2019m really curious about how service apps like Uber will handle things like AI agents, which promise to let you book a car simply by asking an assistant like Alexa or Siri. What\u2019s in it for Uber to have its service commoditized away behind someone else\u2019s interface, especially as it\u2019s trying to grow new lines of business?\nDara had a lot of thoughts here, and it\u2019s clear that the business side of AI agents has just as long a way to go as the actual tech. There\u2019s a lot in this one, and Dara didn\u2019t hold back. I think you\u2019re going to like it.\nOkay: Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. Here we go.\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. \nDara Khosrowshahi, you\u2019re the CEO of Uber. Welcome to Decoder.\nThank you for having me.\nThank you for being here in person. I love doing these conversations in person in our studio here in New York. It\u2019s a different energy, so thank you for coming in.\nIn-person is the new thing.\nI have to ask you, did you take an Uber in New York City to our office?\nI did not take an Uber. The reality in my life is that I need security and all that stuff, so sometimes I take Uber and then the security vehicle follows me. Today we had a lot of traffic, so I couldn\u2019t do it.\nYeah, there was a lot of traffic today.\nI always wonder how often you get to dogfood your own products.\nYou\u2019ve got to dog food your own products. Absolutely.\nTim Cook said in an interview recently that he uses every single Apple product every single day, which mathematically seems very challenging. Do you take them all? Do you take UberX and Uber Black?\nTotally. You can\u2019t do it every single day, but I use Uber. I use Uber Eats. Actually, one of the really important moves I made was starting to deliver. Most Uber employees use Uber as consumers, but not as many use Uber as earners, as drivers, or as couriers. Early on when I joined, we were building more for the rider or the eater than the earner.\nSo when I was in San Francisco during COVID, I was going crazy at home. So I got my e-bike and I started delivering food. Then, I got a Tesla and I started driving folks around. I really do think that it\u2019s important to dogfood. You can\u2019t do it every single day, because you have a day job. But for one, you learn about your product. Just as importantly, you\u2019re setting an example for your employees.\nWhen you were driving people around for Uber, was security in the car with you? How does this work?\nThey were tracking me, and then they were following me to make sure everything was okay.\nThis is the most intense Uber ride of all time.\nIt was really cool. By the way, it\u2019s a lot harder than it looks. When I first started driving, I was so nervous. I didn\u2019t want to screw up. I didn\u2019t want to take the wrong route. It\u2019s actually a lot more challenging than you think it is.\nThere\u2019s a lot to talk about today. You have some news from your Go-Get announcements. You have ways for people to use Uber more consistently, which I think is very interesting. There\u2019s a partnership with VW to launch autonomous rides in Los Angeles next year. That\u2019s on top of all your other autonomous partnerships. I\u2019m obviously very interested in that.\nI want to start with Uber just conceptually right now. If I think of Uber in the most reductive way possible, it\u2019s an app where I open it, I push a button, and a Toyota Highlander will show up anywhere I am in the world.\nPretty much, or another car. For you, a Toyota Highlander.\nIt\u2019s almost always a Toyota Highlander.\nThat\u2019s awesome. I love it.\nThere\u2019s a whole lot to that. But in the most reductive sense, I think that\u2019s how people perceive Uber. It\u2019s a button that makes a car show up.\nI think so, yes.\nIs that the foundation of everything else, or are there more foundations?\nUltimately, we want to be your everyday app, kind of like your iOS for everyday living. We started with rideshare, and that was the core of our business, but then we\u2019ve expanded into other categories. Obviously there\u2019s Uber Eats and grocery. And to some extent, I think we\u2019re building this real-time logistics network.\nIt started with moving people around. Now we\u2019re moving things and food around, and we\u2019re expanding into many, many more categories. But to the consumer, we want to be known as the app that makes your day a little bit easier, that helps you go where you want or get anything that you want.\nThe news includes a bunch of things like Route Share. There\u2019s more ways to use the subscription more consistently, more ways to plan commutes to work. So that core function \u2014 that there\u2019s a supply of people with cars in the world and Uber can aggregate the demand and push the button and the cars will come find you.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the thing that appears to be changing in your news. It\u2019s not \u201cpush the button and the car comes to you.\u201d Instead of commuting, Uber will just manage the logistics of that for you and you will subscribe to it, and that will be a recurring fee. Is that the change here?\nTo some extent, what we\u2019re doing is saving you time with someone else doing the driving instead so you can do whatever you want. Now, there\u2019s a trade-off as it relates to reliability or time and price. The faster you want your ride or the more reliable you want that ride to be, the more it\u2019ll cost us.\nIf you say, \u201cYou know what? I may not need my ride in the next four minutes. I can wait 15 minutes. Or instead of having the car come all the way to me, I can walk two blocks if that makes the network more affordable or I can save money,\u201d then that\u2019s a trade-off you can make. Human beings are always trading off. Essentially you\u2019re paying for your time. With our network, there\u2019s always a trade-off between reliability / time and price.\u00a0\nSo, what we\u2019re trying to do is find products that allow people to self-identify where they want that trade-off. For example, you have a really important trip and are going to take a flight. You need to absolutely know that the Uber is going to be there. You can pick a reserve. You pay a premium for that reserve. The driver shows up early. The reliability is like over 99 percent. That\u2019s one version.\u00a0\nThe other version is for the commuter. This is someone who is going to work every single day using Uber. The price of your commute every day can get up there. So, what we wanted to do is allow somebody to trade off a little bit of price for reliability. For example, we have one product called Routematch, which has set routes coming every 20 minutes, so there\u2019s predictability there. You will share your ride with up to two other people, but you are trading off a little bit. You can\u2019t quite get your ride on demand because there\u2019s a schedule there, and you may share with somebody. You\u2019re trading off a little bit of that personal reliability or time in order to get about 50 percent off.\nSo, we\u2019re constantly making trade-offs as it relates to our services. Originally, when we were thinking about these trade-offs, we thought it was about the demo. There are some people who are less time sensitive and more price sensitive or the other way around. It turns out that that is true, but there are also occasions. An occasion might be travel, where you\u2019re going to pay more to be more reliable. There may be another occasion where if you know the 20-minute increments, you can adjust your life to get that 50 percent off on your commute. So it\u2019s been a really interesting evolution and how we think about the trade-offs and the efficiencies of the network.\nIs convenience on that list of priorities for you? You talked about time and reliability, but it seems like if I open the app, it being inexpensive and right there is as important as all the other stuff.\nI think your definition of convenience may be different. Something that\u2019s cheaper may be more convenient for a person. Something that\u2019s more timely can be more convenient for another. Ultimately, I think convenience is an amalgamation of all of that and it depends on what you consider to be convenient.\nOne of the reasons I asked that question is because in various other parts of the tech industry that we cover, consumers will pick convenience over quality almost every time. The example I use, which is not a one-to-one to Uber, is music. Consumers will pick just the worst quality streaming if it\u2019s available. They\u2019ll watch bootleg YouTube videos of the songs they want to hear. They often will not pay for the high-quality lossless elsewhere. And you can do price discrimination based on that.\nI challenge you a little bit on that because in the early days, bootleg music, bootleg movies, etc. were the biggest use case. But actually as streaming made it more convenient, people were willing to pay. So I do think there\u2019s a price / convenience trade-off and it\u2019s personal. I think habits change as well. We are just trying to figure out what\u2019s the most optimal price / convenience trade-off that we can make to aggregate the most demand and the most supply.\nOne of the reasons I asked about convenience is that you framed Route Share or walking a little bit to get to the spot as reliability. To me it\u2019s actually convenience. I\u2019m going to trade a little bit of convenience and maybe pay a lot less.\nYou can totally go there.\nI read this press release announcing Route Share, and I had this very mid-2010s reaction, which was what if Uber just invented a bus. Did you just invent a bus?\nI think to some extent it\u2019s inspired by the bus. If you step back a little bit, a part of us looking to expand and grow is about making Uber more affordable to more people. I think one of the things that makes tech companies different from most companies out there is that our goal is to lower prices. If we lower the price, then we can extend the audience.\nThere are two ways of lowering price as it relates to Route Share. One is you get more than one person to share a car because cars cost money, drivers\u2019 time costs money, etc., or you reduce the size or price of the vehicle. And we\u2019re doing that actively. For example, with two-wheelers and three-wheelers in a lot of countries. We\u2019ve been going after this shared concept, which is a bus, for many, many years. We started with UberX Share, for example, which is on-demand sharing.\nBut this concept takes it to the next level. If you schedule and create consistency among routes, then I think we can up the matching quotient, so to speak, and then essentially pass the savings on to the consumer. So, call it a next-gen bus, but the goal is just to reduce prices to the consumer and then help with congestion and the environment. That\u2019s all good as well.\nCongestion is interesting. We\u2019re talking in New York City. We\u2019re a few months into the congestion pricing program, which was designed to get people out of their cars and onto the bus, mass transit, even into Ubers and taxis. Have you seen any statistics since congestion pricing has been in effect that says Uber usage has gone up?\nSo Uber usage has gone up, but we don\u2019t have the counterfactual. Would it have gone up if there were no congestion pricing? But what we\u2019re seeing is very similar to some of the public data out there, which says traffic is flowing faster. I think The New York Times said traffic speeds were up like 6 or 7 percent. Uber has very similar numbers as well.\nSo, Ubers are getting there faster, but I don\u2019t have a counterfactual. Was it good or bad for our business? We supported congestion pricing. The way I think about it is that it\u2019s actually taking cars or vehicles that have the lowest utility off the road. It\u2019s a little bit like surge pricing if you think about it, where during peak times, we want to get more drivers out there.\nAt the same time, we want to encourage people who may not need to travel during peak times. We actually want to dampen demand and move it to non-peak times. So, congestion pricing to some extent is a \u201ccity surge.\u201d They\u2019re increasing prices for a certain time, and it removes demand for vehicles that have the lowest utilization. It just so happens that Uber\u2019s taxis are very high utility vehicles on the road.\nYou\u2019re closing in on a decade as the CEO of Uber. The way you talk is very operational. You\u2019re maximizing the utility of these assets on the road, whether your drivers own them (we should talk about the autonomous fleets that seem like they\u2019re going to come into existence). Then, there\u2019s maximizing utility, value, and all this stuff. You took over from a founder who had a much grander vision, which was that no one should own a car and that all transportation should be run by Uber.\nWell, that\u2019s still a vision. Absolutely.\u00a0\nThe way you\u2019re talking about it, likeRoute Share competing with the bus, is it still the vision to take over from those things? Do you perceive yourself to be in competition with public transport?\nNo. Actually, I view that we are in competition with personal car ownership. That was Travis [Kalanick]\u2019s vision as well. Public transport is a teammate. Uber consistently does really well in cities where there\u2019s significant public transport because \u2014 and it goes to what I was talking about earlier \u2014 there are just different use cases. You might take public transport for your downtown commute, but if you\u2019re going to dinner with your friends, then you might take an Uber.\u00a0\nSo, Uber and public transport compete for a particular trip. That\u2019s absolutely true. You have to decide, \u201cAm I going to take the bus, am I going to take the subway, or am I going to take an Uber?\u201d As it relates to your life, we\u2019re very much complements.\u00a0\nThe big kahuna that we\u2019re going after is car ownership. That ultimately is a vision. It remains a vision. It\u2019s hard to do because the car is a really flexible product with mass manufacturing and it\u2019s really cost-effective. So, it\u2019s going to take a lot of work to get there. We\u2019re less than 3 percent of miles traveled on the road even though we\u2019re a very big company. We\u2019ve got a long way to go, but the vision definitely hasn\u2019t changed.\nAre there some markets where you think you\u2019ve made a bigger dent in car ownership than others?\nI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve made a bigger dent, but there are definitely some markets where our penetration of miles traveled is higher. For example, in Latin America, our penetration is very high. Penetration in New York or other big US cities where there is mass transit is higher as well. I haven\u2019t looked at whether we\u2019ve made a dent in ownership.\nAnother way to think about it is there\u2019s some percentage of people who would\u2019ve gotten a car but Uber exists in their life. Do you track that? Do you measure that?\nWe don\u2019t track that. But I can tell you \u2014 this drives me crazy. My son is over 18. I don\u2019t know about you but did you get a license the minute you could drive?\nOh yeah. At 15-and-a-half, in Wisconsin.\nExactly! It was just such a thing. It was a goal in life. It represented freedom. I\u2019m still trying to get my son to get his driver\u2019s license, but Uber\u2019s freed him up. If you look at the percentage of 16 or 18 year olds who are getting their license, that percentage is coming down significantly. I think it used to be two-thirds, but now it\u2019s probably in the 50 percent range. I could be wrong. So, it is absolutely having an effect on car ownership.\nDo you think that\u2019s a leading indicator for Uber success, or is that a lagging indicator of Fortnite success?\n[Laughs] Probably the two are mixed. I also think it\u2019s an indication of the urbanization of our populations, but I haven\u2019t actually looked into whether heavy Fortnite players are Uber users as well. I suspect they may be. Certainly Uber Eats users.\nI\u2019m going to leave that one alone. There\u2019s another hour of PhD-level sociology in that comment alone.\nCorrelation, causation, who knows.\nLet\u2019s talk about Uber itself. You took over in 2017. You took over a company led by a very strong founder who had a vision of how the company should be run. How is Uber structured at this point? This is a classic Decoder question.\nWe have a combination matrix and line of business structure, so we have two global leads: one for our mobility business and one for our delivery business. Then, most of the other functions \u2014 marketing and PR, government relations, product finance, etc. \u2014\u00a0 are matrixed. I would say that as the company has matured, we have matrixed more, which I think happens to a lot of companies that mature. Their practices become more predictable and they\u2019re trying to bring a higher degree of expertise into those practices. So, it\u2019s a combination. We constantly have this creative battle between the lines of businesses and the matrices. Ultimately, I think it works.\nI mean, that\u2019s the tension. I think the listeners know that the secret of the show is I can just guess at 80 percent of the problems if you tell me the structure of the company.\nListen, I think that the conflict is constructive. This is a terrible metaphor, but if you look at purebred dogs, they tend to get sick more, like bulldogs that have been bred year after year after year, versus hybrids that aren\u2019t pure breeds. To some extent, I think that companies that have a structure that\u2019s one note \u2014\u00a0 there\u2019s a line of business (LOB) structure or a matrix-only structure \u2014 there\u2019s a lack of conflict that sometimes allows the strength of the weakness of either structure to go overboard. Matrix structures are usually associated with more efficiency, but slower decision making. LOB are sometimes much faster but have difficulty scaling.\u00a0\nI think my directs and some of the teams get frustrated with conflict. Some of these decisions come up to me. But I think the conflict is actually really healthy. The conflict is what allows us to not fall prey because these two teams are constantly keeping each other in check. If you\u2019ve got a matrix function, it may not realize that, let\u2019s say, the marketing in Egypt is not sharp enough, but the Egypt GM is living and dying by that marketing. So the two keep each other in balance. That Egypt GM might not know what an absolutely first-rate marketer is. That conflict keeps those two in check and ultimately gets a better outcome. Conflict can be unpleasant, but I think the fight makes us better.\nAs a guy who runs a single vertical line of business in a matrix company, I understand what you\u2019re saying.\nThere\u2019s no perfect way.\nPut that into practice. You have a hypothetical there. What\u2019s an example where you have had to mediate that conflict?\nI think marketing is one, since we just talked about that. I\u2019ve had to mediate as it relates to, let\u2019s say, the allocation of capital. Every single line of business and GM is going to want some budget for branding because they\u2019re fighting it out on the ground. Then, if you look on a global basis, how do you allocate that marketing spend? The answer to the global solution may be different than the answer to the request of that Egypt GM. Those answers during planning may be different.\u00a0\nEarly on as we were building this matrix structure, there was a lot of conflict. Now, the teams have a real understanding. They\u2019re getting into a rhythm, and the conflicts get to me much less often. Same thing with product. Product prioritization is very similar, with a constant push and pull.\nAs a global company, you want to build globalized products that are as similar to each other as possible. At the same time, there are local competitors that may have some product twists and turns that may be only applicable to that market and\u00a0 may not make sense for you to build on a global basis. That push and pull is a tough one sometimes.\nWhen I say 80 percent of the problems, that\u2019s the one I can usually guess at with 100 percent accuracy. How do you solve that? Do you have local product teams that are allowed to just make Uber whatever they want?\nWe have the GMs on the ground who really keep the product teams accountable, but our product planning is global by nature and it is not perfect. Sometimes the GMs who yell the loudest get their way. We want to make sure that our product people travel to the market so they feel the pain of the market, so to speak. Honestly, it\u2019s something we have to keep working on. We don\u2019t have it perfect by any means.\nThere\u2019s a difference there from the founder-led company that is totally functional at the beginning with gobs of VC money coming in. I mean, that\u2019s the early Uber, right? We have a bunch of zero-interest-rate VC money and we\u2019re going to win by just buying all the drivers in a market, setting the prices to zero, and we\u2019ll figure it out in the end. And that was totally functional. You\u2019ve created it in a different structure. I\u2019m just wondering, how did you make that transition?\nLet me correct you there. It wasn\u2019t functional. It was GM-led.\nEven back in the day?\nThe GMs were mini CEOs of every single country. Travis would hire a GM and parachute them into a market. You\u2019re right that we did go out and buy supply. As a company, we really are supply-led, where first you build liquid supply and then you invest in demand. In the early days, you essentially had to price under market and lose a bunch of money.\nAs liquidity increases, the matches increase, and the efficiency of the market increases, you can start pulling more profits from a marketplace. That was essentially the formula. It might\u2019ve seemed crazy at the time, but I think that Travis and the founding team got it right. Creating liquidity in the marketplace is exactly what allows you to get to profitability. Whoever created the liquidity supply and demand fastest was the one who ultimately won.\u00a0\nSo in the early days, it was all GMs spending a ton of money on liquidity. When I came in, I started to globalize some of those matrix functions. It took time. It was painful at times, but I think we\u2019re at the right balance now.\nWhat\u2019s the hardest choice you had to make along that way?\nThe hardest choice was actually on product. Specifically, when I was around for a while, our Rides and Eats businesses were complete verticals. So you had different ops teams, different marketing teams, and different product teams. Eats was competing against pure plays: DoorDash, Just Eat, Deliveroo, etc. Eats was 10 or 15 percent of the business.\nSo if you decide to matrix that function, for example, is your head of product going to spend time on the 85 percent for Rides or are they going to spend time on the 15 percent for Eats? And no matter how much I said, \u201cHey, spend time on Eats,\u201d they were getting paid for Ride\u2019s success. So, we went a few years with Rides and Eats essentially being totally separate.\u00a0\nThen, there was a big decision that we made to combine the product teams and the product and tech teams. That\u2019s what makes the company go. There\u2019s a lot more that happens around it, but if you don\u2019t have great product or you\u2019re not strong technically, you\u2019re going to suffer. That decision was probably the hardest decision. It came with some bumps and bruises, but I think it was a really, really good decision. For one, Eats got big enough for everybody in the company to care about it, once it got past that 15 percent.\u00a0\nSecond, we were late to the game with Eats. We were years behind the other pure players. So if you ask yourself, \u201cWhy is Eats going to win?,\u201d we obviously had great talent, but you have to assume your competitors have great talent as well. The answer was the platform. Uber as a brand was an everyday use case, and you could actually introduce your audience who are using Rides on a daily basis to Eats. We then launched a membership program that worked for both.\u00a0\nThe platform and the fact that we have greater scale than anyone else allows us to invest more and then cross-sell our riders into eaters. Now more are eaters into riders. Then, encourage drivers to move people but also move things every once in a while.\nI want to ask you about cross-selling on the platform in a very specific way. but you\u2019ve walked right into the other big Decoder question I ask everybody, which is about decisions. You just described a big decision. What\u2019s your framework for making decisions?\nOne framework that I use is, \u201cis it a one-way door or a two-way door?\u201d That\u2019s classic Amazon. I think Jeff Bezos introduced it. It\u2019s a great framework.\nOne day we\u2019re going to make a supercut of people saying that on the show.\nSo many people have been impacted by him, and deservedly so. He\u2019s one of the great CEOs of the world. Just make the decision. Use your instinct. It\u2019s always a two-way door, that\u2019s easy. But that\u2019s an example of a one-way door.\nYou mean merging the product teams?\nYeah, merging the product teams. You\u2019ve got to go for it. I can\u2019t tell you that there was a perfect construct one way or the other. At some point, you have to make some of these decisions based on instinct. One of the constructs is what do you have to believe so that the outcome of what you\u2019re doing today is going to change? So, if I keep doing the same thing but I do it an inch and a half better, am I going to get to the Promised Land? Is that just going to take way too much time, or is there uncertainty in getting there where I need a shock to the system?\u00a0\nAs it relates to Eats, we did unbelievably well in the early days, but there was a point where we were hitting a ceiling. It was then where I decided that to get to that next level, we actually need a shock to the system, and we changed our organizational structure.\nIn hindsight, I think it was a really good decision, not necessarily because of the product side. We still have dedicated Rides and Eats product leaders. It was actually more on the engineering side, on the code base. It allowed our engineers to generalize a code base to take some of, let\u2019s say, our marketplace talent from Rides, who were second to none, and move them over to Eats.\nIt\u2019ll take a little while, but I\u2019ll give you a quick example of some of these unanticipated benefits. When you order an Uber ride, we essentially have to scan the market for all the cars out there and where they\u2019re going, and are they available or not available. We have to match you to a car, and we\u2019ve got to price that ride in less than 30 seconds. We want the ETA to be four or five minutes, and so we have very, very little time to make that decision.\u00a0\nSo, the algorithms that are running have to work very quickly. They\u2019re making tens of millions of predictions per second. Make that match and go. That takes certain architecture and a bunch of compute. With Eats, we have the average time to make food at like 10 to 12 minutes. So, you have a lot more time to make that match.\u00a0\nBut we had to make all the same calculus. Where is the courier? Which courier should I match you with? How do I price you? The time with which we had to make the match on the courier side was much longer. So we would recalc the marketplace in two or three minutes. With Eats, we essentially make a bid to a courier who can accept the delivery or not. Let\u2019s say for a delivery that I\u2019ve got three bids I can make before the food gets cold. My first bid might be $6. If they said no, the second bid may be $7. If they said \u201cNo, I really have to get you the food,\u201d the third bid might be $10. Once we switched the teams over, the Rides team said, \u201cOh no, we can make this recalc in 15 seconds.\u201d\nNow, we\u2019ve got the ability to make 10 bids. So instead of going from six to seven to 10, you go from $6 to $6.50, $6.75, $7. So the ultimate cost per transaction is lower just because of compute, speed of algorithms, and decision-making. I didn\u2019t anticipate that when I made the switch, but those kinds of benefits \u2014 in terms of back end code, engineering, just scale \u2014 were actually the biggest we saw.\nI understand why that\u2019s great for me as a customer because cost comes down. I understand why it\u2019s great for Uber because the margin goes up. Is that good for the courier?\nWell, the couriers get more business. For example, our ability to make more bids has allowed us to increase the number of batches. So now the courier is carrying two goods and gets tipped twice close to 50 percent of the time. That was a side benefit for the courier as well, which we think ultimately helps earnings.\nThe way you\u2019re describing Uber is as a platform. A lot of the announcements are about using it more as a platform: \u201cEngage with us more often in your life.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a kind of cold platform, but it\u2019s an everyday use case.\nThe reason I ask about this is because maybe 60 percent of the interviews I\u2019ve done on Decoder this year are people telling me they\u2019re going to build AI agents. You\u2019re just going to talk to the computer and the Toyota Camry is going to show up.\nAI is a cool thing.\nEveryone is telling me this is going to happen in ways big and small, whether we\u2019re building Model Context Protocol applications at the bleeding edge of tech standards or whether we\u2019re just going to click around on your website using a testing tool, which is a real product that exists in this world. And Uber has been clicked around by these products.\nThose all disintermediate your platform. You have to do the hard work of creating liquidity of supply and making sure the Toyota Camry appears, and they own the customer relationship. Why would you ever participate in this? I ask them all this question. They\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. The market will figure it out.\u201d I\u2019m like, that\u2019s you! You\u2019re the market. But you\u2019re the other side of the market. Would you participate?\nIt\u2019s a really good question. We talk about it all the time, and time will tell as to what the right decision is. I believe in running open platforms. I don\u2019t believe in companies that try to fight the course that technology is taking. They always get left behind. I think we should go to where consumers want us to go. I do think that\u2019s all nicey-nicey, but at the same time, one of the advantages that we have is our unique inventory.\nEssentially, we\u2019ve got 8.5 million drivers and couriers and over 1.2 million merchants out there. It\u2019s very difficult for a company that has an agent to disintermediate us and go direct to the almost 10 million pieces of inventory, if you want to be impersonal. These are people, these are businesses. It\u2019s very difficult for them to draw that inventory. While you may make your inventory available to these agents, you can charge a toll if you have unique inventory. So, if the agents bring us more demand, which means\u00a0 more orders for our restaurant partners or more rides for our drivers, that\u2019s worth something for us.\nAt the same time, because we\u2019re becoming more and more of an everyday use case \u2014 the frequency of our average user is six times a month and it continues to increase \u2014 we can create our own local agents. We know it\u2019s your commute time, so why don\u2019t we get you a car? Maybe we can actually make a dispatch to the car before you actually push the button to get it because we can predict that you\u2019re going to do it.\nSo I think, as it relates to AI and these agents, we want to work with these players. We come from a place of strength because of the unique inventory and the fragmentation of these markets that we\u2019re organizing. We\u2019re going to build our own agents as well. As long as we\u2019re thinking about the consumer, our earners, and our merchants, I think we\u2019ll be okay.\nLet\u2019s say I start Nilay\u2019s Model Company with Nilay\u2019s Voice Assistant, and I want to get people sandwiches. I want you to be able to say, \u201cI need to go to the airport, get me a car. Go read my email, figure out when my flight is, schedule a car.\u201d This is the dream. For some reason, we\u2019ve got to throw giant data centers at this problem. This is what they pitch me.\u00a0\nSo, I come to you and I say, \u201cI want to be able to get cars from Uber.\u201d What is the percentage toll? What is the extra margin you would have to charge me, in dollars and cents, to make it worth it for me to take the customer away from you in that way? Because when the customer opens your app, you get to cross-sell them into Uber One or ask if they would like some food when they arrive. There\u2019s all these other incremental opportunities that you would forego if I take that customer.\nSo I have a weird philosophy on this. Initially, I charge you zero. I think that companies sometimes\u2013\nAlarm bells just went off at every level.\nNo, listen! People spend so much time trying to figure out what the economics might be when the first thing is to try it out. Is it going to be a good experience or not? Is your scheduling actually going to work, or is it going to be off and the driver has to wait for 10 minutes, which is terrible? Let\u2019s just figure it out. Then, once you optimize the experience, we can measure. Are you an incremental consumer for Uber or are you totally cannibalistic?\nIf it\u2019s cannibalistic, then I\u2019m going to charge a lot of money. You can\u2019t have any money because you\u2019re getting the benefit and my content. You\u2019re not bringing me any business at all. If it is incremental, then I would pay some take rate. Is it a 5 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent take rate? It depends on the incrementality.\u00a0\nBut I think so much innovation has slowed down because companies try to figure out the economics first. Figure out the experience first and then the economics. Listen, if I do a bad deal for a year, who cares? I\u2019m going to renegotiate with you. I\u2019m building stuff for the next 10 years. Success or failure isn\u2019t going to be determined by my take rate being 5 or 20 percent in year one. It can set precedent, and precedents are dangerous. That\u2019s why I would say to charge zero. Let\u2019s try it out. Let\u2019s see what the experience is. Let\u2019s try to measure out what the value add is, and then the economics will take care of themselves.\nYou said you\u2019re having these conversations a lot internally at Uber. What is the shape of those conversations? Are there partners you\u2019re excited to work with? Are there agents you\u2019ve seen that are promising?\nWe\u2019re working with a number of players. I\u2019d say OpenAI is probably the top player we\u2019re working with as it relates to agents. It\u2019s imperfect. It\u2019s really early. The volume is tiny right now. The work is just to make the experience really great. It\u2019s way too early for me to tell you if it\u2019s going to work or not. Eventually it will, but I don\u2019t know the shape right now, so I want to experiment.\nWhen you think about that particular future, everybody wants this product. Again, 60 percent of my conversations are people just dreaming of a future where you talk to the robots and the robots go do stuff for you.\nNot a bad future.\nThat implies a lot of things. At the very beginning, it implies that Uber exists so you even have an API for you to go ask for a car from. At the base layer of that it implies that Toyota exists, and that there are literally vehicles with an effectively standardized service, support, and maintenance network around the world. The Toyota Camry is an atomic unit of transportation across the entire world, and that\u2019s an amazing thing that you depend on so that people can talk to the robot and the car will show up.\nThere\u2019s another change happening here that I think is fascinating, which is the move to autonomous vehicles and fleet operators for those vehicles. You are a participant in that with Waymo in Atlanta and Austin. Part of your recent announcement here is that VW is going to launch in Los Angeles with you guys next year.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s going to change the dynamics of those cars completely. You don\u2019t have independent contractors with the Toyota Camry atomic unit that you don\u2019t have to worry about. Where do we get wheels for a Toyota Camry? It\u2019s just not a problem that Uber has to solve. Cars start driving themselves and suddenly, a lot of people have to worry about different things. How do you think that\u2019s going to change while the agents are coming for you?\nOh my god, now you\u2019ve added agents to the mix.\nAt the end of the day, I think what you really want to do is say, \u201cI need a car,\u201d and then there\u2019s just a network of autonomous vehicles waiting to accept bids.\nI think you\u2019re correlating two things that I would separate. I was trained as an engineer, and you want to separate and simplify the two problems, although they may interact in certain ways. We talked about agents. If I bring value in by creating inventory for that agent, the value\u2019s going to be determined based on whether that demand for the agent is incremental or not. If it\u2019s not incremental, the value\u2019s really small, which means the content provider should get the vast majority of the economics. If it is incremental, then we\u2019ll talk about the value of that incrementality.\u00a0\nNow, when you look at autonomous vehicles, you\u2019re essentially replacing the driver with a machine. Our everyday drivers not only drive. That\u2019s their main job, but they usually own the car, refuel the car, clean the car, etc. So you have to replace that work set. First is the software layer. Waymo is working on it, there\u2019s VW. There are tons of different companies, like Pony and WeRide, that are working on that. We want to work with all the software providers, make sure they\u2019re safe and affordable, and bring them to market.\u00a0\nSecond is the car itself. The car can\u2019t just be a good, old-fashioned car. It has to be a super car. It\u2019s wheels but also a sensor kit. It needs much, much more compute to work, and the cost of that hardware right now is inordinately expensive. But it will come down after a couple of generations. Then, you have fleet management, which we just talked about and involves cleaning cars, etc., and then fleet ownership as well. The manager may own the car or ultimately\u2026\u00a0 actually I think you\u2019re going to have car ownership by the Blackstones of the world. Right now, Marriott doesn\u2019t own any of its hotels. There are these entities called REITs that own the hotels. There will be fleets, with these financial companies and retirement pension funds owning big fleets of cars.\nOur job is going to be bringing demand to these really expensive cars. These AVs are so expensive, you\u2019re not going to have that many of them on the road in the early days. So, there will be a hybrid model like we have in Austin right now. If a Waymo happens to be close to you, we\u2019ll hail a Waymo. If the Waymo is 10 minutes away and there are a bunch of drivers who are really close, we\u2019ll get you a driver.\nThe percentage of AVs over a period of time is going to increase, and our job is going to be to manage that shift smoothly and make sure that the utilization, whether it\u2019s a Waymo or VW, is really high. Right now, what we\u2019re seeing in Austin is that the average Waymo is 99 percent more productive in terms of trips per day than the average driver. So we can really drive utilization.\u00a0\nUltimately, if the demand for that Waymo comes through the Uber app the old-fashioned way, through an Uber agent, or through an OpenAI or another agent, I don\u2019t think it really matters in terms of the autonomous transition. That\u2019s going to happen separately. We want to manage it. Where that demand comes from, whether agent, app, or something that we haven\u2019t imagined, that\u2019s a separate issue. So we just have to manage both transitions. I don\u2019t think the two are really going to conflict with each other.\nLet me try to make them conflict.\nAll right. I like it.\nYou have some big partners. I think a lot of people assumed Waymo would be a competitor, but you found ways to partner with them.\nI think they\u2019re a competitor and a partner. I\u2019ll give you an example. Domino\u2019s is a competitor to Uber Eats because sometimes people go directly to the Domino\u2019s app, and it\u2019s a partner at the same time. I think people look for the drama, like if you are with me or are you against me. The fact is that they work with us \u2014 coopetition or whatever you want to call it. Waymo\u2019s going to work with us in certain circumstances, and it\u2019s going to be looking to bring customers directly in others.\nRight, because you control a whole bunch of demand for their product.\nYes.\nThe one competitor I don\u2019t see making as pragmatic a decision as that is Tesla. We will see how [the Robotaxi] actually exists, but the way it has been described is it\u2019s going to take everyone\u2019s individually owned Teslas, flip on some software, and while you\u2019re sleeping, they\u2019re going to go off and drive at night.\nI have a lot of questions generally about where the demand in the middle of the night comes from, but so it goes. But that\u2019s a system where you suddenly increase a bunch of autonomous car inventory that is just floating around the city, and you can get demand by just saying, \u201cI need a car.\u201d Then, you have an individual unit of supply that\u2019s like, \u201cHere I am.\u201d You can build an entirely other system that does not require paying you a transaction fee.\u00a0\nThat does feel like how you can combine these two ideas because the individual operator of the Tesla Robotaxi might have a different approach. How do you reconcile that? Do you think Tesla\u2019s going to make that work? Do you think that all those people are going to end up turning over their houses to Airbnb management companies like Airbnb owners do?\nI think it remains to be seen. We have to take anything that Tesla does seriously. Elon Musk\u2019s an unbelievable entrepreneur. He\u2019s built so many companies. My thinking is that the individual owner of the Tesla is going to get a subset of demand if that demand can only come from Tesla. Then, he or she could get from Tesla demand plus Uber demand.\u00a0\nSo 10 years from now, every single Toyota comes with self-driving software. I think that is relatively likely. You can buy a Toyota and when you\u2019re asleep put that Toyota on Uber, which has unbelievable amounts of demand, and make X dollars per day. Or you can buy a Tesla and put it on the Tesla app, which I think is going to have less demand. Ultimately, if you\u2019re looking out for the owner and you want to allow them to monetize as much as possible, that owner\u2019s going to look for the most demand, which is actually going to drive them to multi-source.\nThis is why five years ago, Domino\u2019s was on its earnings calls saying, \u201cI\u2019m never going to use third-party apps,\u201d and it is now. Ultimately, it\u2019s a restaurant, and you want to monetize that restaurant as best you can, and having multiple platforms feeding that restaurant, so to speak, is mathematically the best way. So, I\u2019m hoping that Tesla eventually decides, \u201cI can build my direct channel, but I can also work for Uber.\u201d That\u2019s ultimately best for Tesla owners.\nHave you talked to Tesla about collaborating in any way?\nWe talk to them all the time. I think there are 150,000 Teslas on the network. We\u2019d love to collaborate with them, and if they want to take us up on that, we\u2019re game.\nDo you think they can actually pull off the Robotaxi fleet as they\u2019ve described it?\nI don\u2019t know.\u00a0 From my standpoint \u2014 and this is judgment \u2014 you really need superhuman safety. Superhuman, to me, doesn\u2019t mean better than a human. It means five times better than a human. I think the data suggests that Waymo is around that level. It\u2019s not 100 percent clear to me whether camera-only can get there. Most of the players who are building this technology from the ground up are going with cameras and LiDAR to have redundancy as it relates to perception. If Tesla can do it, more power to them. We\u2019ll see. I think time will tell.\nThe thing that I think about is what I already mentioned, which is that I know what kind of riders exist in the middle of the night. I was one of those riders in my 20s, and it just seems like there\u2019s going to be an awful lot of puke in an awful lot of Teslas.\nThere\u2019s a lot that drivers do that we take for granted. There\u2019s a lot of work.\nHow do you manage that with your autonomous fleet now? Somebody gets sick in the car, somebody makes a mess in the car, and you don\u2019t know about it until the next rider shows up.\nThat\u2019s something that you have to handle, which is a rider complaint, or you might have cameras inside the car, for example. The newer cars have that.\nDo you make an AI puke detector?\nI guess we\u2019re going to have to build that. That\u2019s going to go into our product roadmap.\nSmell-O-Vision in the car to make sure.\nThat\u2019s an interesting one, but that essentially is going to be the job of the fleet operator.\nHow does that cut work with the fleet operator? I took an Uber to work today. I figured I should use your app before I talked to you. I asked the driver and he said, \u201cI want my rates to go up.\u201d Maybe every driver I\u2019ve ever talked to wants that.\nEveryone wants to make more money. Absolutely.\nThat\u2019s the driver\u2019s perspective. I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re going to make the rates go up with big fleet operators who now have giant fixed costs, are happy to have 24/7 utilization, and maybe take a lower rate for greater use while the drivers just want high rates. How do you square that circle? It feels like the driver rates are going to get pushed down as autonomy comes into the mix.\nOur job is going to be managing the balance between demand and supply. So, I think autonomy is actually going to drive more demand. Even though autonomous inventory is going to be an ever-increasing percentage of our overall inventory, the number of drivers that we need on our network over the next 5-10 years is going to increase because demand increases more, so to speak.\nTwenty years from now, you might be right. From that standpoint, we just have to manage our inventory. There\u2019s a turnover of drivers all the time, and we want to make sure that we give drivers the right earnings expectations. In a city where demand isn\u2019t growing because autonomous supply is coming in, maybe we just have to slow down driver recruitment and not make them promises as it relates to earnings.\nSo, I think communication, being straight with people, is the ultimate answer. But I don\u2019t take it for granted. This is going to be a transition that we have to manage very, very carefully and make sure that our driver base is taken care of.\nWhat do you think the deals with the fleet operators will look like? Maybe the entire thesis of The Verge is that adding computers to things makes them very complicated, and we should pay attention to that complexity. I\u2019ll use the Toyota Camry again, but with the Honda Accord or the Chevy Malibu my parents had in the \u201980s when I was a kid, you didn\u2019t have to update the software. They didn\u2019t have buffer overflows. The infotainment deck did not restart in the middle of the day.\nThey might have cranky mechanical issues, but again, there\u2019s an ecosystem to help fix that very quickly. If you get a flat tire in New York, you can just push the car around the corner and there\u2019s a taxi garage waiting for you. That\u2019s incredible. You\u2019ve got a bunch of cars that have tons and tons of software at the bleeding edge of technology, yet cameras can get dirty or broken or whatever. That\u2019s a different set of costs on top of the existing mechanical costs. You\u2019re not going to repair the robotic cars. The fleet managers are going to.\nWe actually work with fleet managers today, and the reason is that a bunch of drivers can\u2019t afford vehicles or can\u2019t get loans for vehicles. Companies can. Also, we\u2019re actively trying to electrify our vehicle base. Close to 10 percent of our vehicles are now electric, with more than 20 percent in certain cities in Europe. So, we have experience with fleet operators. About 15 percent of our volume comes from fleet operators. Many of those fleet operators own the cars. Not all fleet operators own the cars. I think if they own the cars, then they\u2019re just looking for a return on invested capital, and the return is going to depend on the risk. The more volume we bring them, then the cheaper the cars are going to be because utilization is going to be really, really high.\nThen, there are going to be some pure play fleet operators where the financial players are going to own the cars. That\u2019s going to look more like cost plus. So if it costs you $10 to operate the fleet, we\u2019ll pay you $11 or $12. Our philosophy right now, as I said earlier, is to make the damn thing work, make it safe, and then worry about the economics. AV loses money for us right now, but we know it\u2019s going to be huge in the future. It\u2019s going to ultimately bring the cost of our service down, and it\u2019s going to make the street safer. For us now, it\u2019s about making the system work, and then the economics are going to fall into place.\u00a0\nBut I think fleet operations will be a part of the ecosystem and they won\u2019t be the majority. What we will bring to these autonomous players is an end-to-end solution. So, they have to work on what they\u2019re really good at, which is self-driving algorithms, and then leave the rest up to us.\nBut it\u2019s that middle part that I\u2019m just focused on.\nWell, we work with these fleet operators. For example, one of our fleet partners is operating the Waymo fleet in Austin right now. Certain players may want to do the fleet operation themselves, but I think that our local on-the-ground expertise and the fact that we are running fleets with millions of cars today will be another benefit. I don\u2019t know if VW in LA is going to want to operate its own fleet. We will be able to bring that capability. If they want to do it themselves, that\u2019s totally fine as well.\nI think I\u2019m just stuck on that the fleet operators are going to have a bunch of really highly paid IT people sitting around rebooting the fiber optic networks of these cars.\nIf it\u2019s just the reboot, that\u2019ll be easy. Again, these are complex vehicles. The cost of the vehicles is really high right now, and the care for those vehicles is going to be not-zero.\nWhen you think about the safety side, which you\u2019ve talked about several times now, the question of autonomous liability exists in the world. I book a Waymo through Uber. The Waymo gets in an accident. Who accepts that liability today?\nWe think early on, most of the self-driving companies will self-insure. They\u2019re big companies. They can afford to self-insure. But ultimately, whether they insure, we insure, or the owners insure, it\u2019ll work itself out.\nWhat is the mechanism for working it out?\nLooking at the incident rate and looking at the cost per incident. I think incident rates are going to come way down, especially if these autonomous vehicles are superhuman safe. Cost per incident is going to go up, which is because the cars are much more expensive. But I think that the overall cost of insurance as a percentage of your ride is going to come way down because of the safety of these cars.\nWe\u2019re almost out of time here. I\u2019ve got to ask you the last question in honor of my Uber driver today. If you were to tell Uber drivers today, \u201cHere\u2019s how I will make you make more money,\u201d what would you say?\nI would say we\u2019re going to bring you more rides. The income for Uber drivers in New York, for example, is more than $50 per utilized hour. New York\u2019s an expensive place, but we think that\u2019s a pretty good trade-off for a job that brings lots and lots of flexibility. But it\u2019s a hard job, traffic is tough. So, we\u2019ll keep working on it. Ultimately, the way to offer more earnings to drivers is to bring more demand, and every single day we\u2019re working on that.\nDara, this is great. Thank you so much for being on Decoder.\nThank you. I really appreciate it.\nQuestions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com. We really do read every email!",
    "content": "\n\n\n\nToday, I\u2019m talking with Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. We recorded this conversation the day Uber announced a big set of product updates, including new options for shared rides and some features to make commuting easier and more predictable. Dara was in New York for all that, so he came to our studio, and we did this one together, which always makes for a great episode.\nAs it happens, the traffic in New York that day was truly terrible \u2014 so we started by talking about how often Dara actually takes an Uber, what that\u2019s like for him, and what it\u2019s like when he goes and serves as an Uber driver, something he does regularly. There\u2019s a lot of security around an Uber Eats delivery when Dara\u2019s behind the wheel, it turns out.\n\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems.\u00a0Subscribe\u00a0here!\n\nUber might be the single best example of the major service apps that boomed into existence in the early part of the smartphone era. In the simplest terms, I think of it as the button that can make a Toyota Camry appear nearly anywhere in the world. But underneath that simple idea is a complicated dance with tons of dependencies. Since he took over for founder Travis Kalanick almost a decade ago, it\u2019s been Dara\u2019s job to really operationalize and smooth the company out into a stable, profitable organization.\nThat\u2019s Decoder bait through and through, so we spent a lot of time deep in how Dara thinks about Uber\u2019s various businesses, how they\u2019re split between product functions and the regional teams in all the countries that Uber operates in, and how Uber plans to grow as things like Waymo and other autonomous vehicle companies enter the picture.\nLike so many mature service companies, a big part of the answer is to try and become a consistent part in people\u2019s lives that drives recurring revenue \u2013 that\u2019s things like Uber One subscriptions, but also bulk trip discounts for regular commuters. And Uber\u2019s biggest news last week was something it called Route Share: predetermined spots where an Uber is guaranteed to come every 20 minutes and pick you up.\nYes, I asked Dara if Uber had just reinvented the bus. His answer is that Uber should be a complement to great public transit, and we talked a little about congestion pricing in New York and how that\u2019s playing out in the data that Uber can see.\nIf you\u2019ve been listening to Decoder recently, you know that I\u2019m really curious about how service apps like Uber will handle things like AI agents, which promise to let you book a car simply by asking an assistant like Alexa or Siri. What\u2019s in it for Uber to have its service commoditized away behind someone else\u2019s interface, especially as it\u2019s trying to grow new lines of business?\nDara had a lot of thoughts here, and it\u2019s clear that the business side of AI agents has just as long a way to go as the actual tech. There\u2019s a lot in this one, and Dara didn\u2019t hold back. I think you\u2019re going to like it.\nOkay: Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. Here we go.\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. \nDara Khosrowshahi, you\u2019re the CEO of Uber. Welcome to Decoder.\nThank you for having me.\nThank you for being here in person. I love doing these conversations in person in our studio here in New York. It\u2019s a different energy, so thank you for coming in.\nIn-person is the new thing.\nI have to ask you, did you take an Uber in New York City to our office?\nI did not take an Uber. The reality in my life is that I need security and all that stuff, so sometimes I take Uber and then the security vehicle follows me. Today we had a lot of traffic, so I couldn\u2019t do it.\nYeah, there was a lot of traffic today.\nI always wonder how often you get to dogfood your own products.\nYou\u2019ve got to dog food your own products. Absolutely.\nTim Cook said in an interview recently that he uses every single Apple product every single day, which mathematically seems very challenging. Do you take them all? Do you take UberX and Uber Black?\nTotally. You can\u2019t do it every single day, but I use Uber. I use Uber Eats. Actually, one of the really important moves I made was starting to deliver. Most Uber employees use Uber as consumers, but not as many use Uber as earners, as drivers, or as couriers. Early on when I joined, we were building more for the rider or the eater than the earner.\nSo when I was in San Francisco during COVID, I was going crazy at home. So I got my e-bike and I started delivering food. Then, I got a Tesla and I started driving folks around. I really do think that it\u2019s important to dogfood. You can\u2019t do it every single day, because you have a day job. But for one, you learn about your product. Just as importantly, you\u2019re setting an example for your employees.\nWhen you were driving people around for Uber, was security in the car with you? How does this work?\nThey were tracking me, and then they were following me to make sure everything was okay.\nThis is the most intense Uber ride of all time.\nIt was really cool. By the way, it\u2019s a lot harder than it looks. When I first started driving, I was so nervous. I didn\u2019t want to screw up. I didn\u2019t want to take the wrong route. It\u2019s actually a lot more challenging than you think it is.\nThere\u2019s a lot to talk about today. You have some news from your Go-Get announcements. You have ways for people to use Uber more consistently, which I think is very interesting. There\u2019s a partnership with VW to launch autonomous rides in Los Angeles next year. That\u2019s on top of all your other autonomous partnerships. I\u2019m obviously very interested in that.\nI want to start with Uber just conceptually right now. If I think of Uber in the most reductive way possible, it\u2019s an app where I open it, I push a button, and a Toyota Highlander will show up anywhere I am in the world.\nPretty much, or another car. For you, a Toyota Highlander.\nIt\u2019s almost always a Toyota Highlander.\nThat\u2019s awesome. I love it.\nThere\u2019s a whole lot to that. But in the most reductive sense, I think that\u2019s how people perceive Uber. It\u2019s a button that makes a car show up.\nI think so, yes.\nIs that the foundation of everything else, or are there more foundations?\nUltimately, we want to be your everyday app, kind of like your iOS for everyday living. We started with rideshare, and that was the core of our business, but then we\u2019ve expanded into other categories. Obviously there\u2019s Uber Eats and grocery. And to some extent, I think we\u2019re building this real-time logistics network.\nIt started with moving people around. Now we\u2019re moving things and food around, and we\u2019re expanding into many, many more categories. But to the consumer, we want to be known as the app that makes your day a little bit easier, that helps you go where you want or get anything that you want.\nThe news includes a bunch of things like Route Share. There\u2019s more ways to use the subscription more consistently, more ways to plan commutes to work. So that core function \u2014 that there\u2019s a supply of people with cars in the world and Uber can aggregate the demand and push the button and the cars will come find you.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the thing that appears to be changing in your news. It\u2019s not \u201cpush the button and the car comes to you.\u201d Instead of commuting, Uber will just manage the logistics of that for you and you will subscribe to it, and that will be a recurring fee. Is that the change here?\nTo some extent, what we\u2019re doing is saving you time with someone else doing the driving instead so you can do whatever you want. Now, there\u2019s a trade-off as it relates to reliability or time and price. The faster you want your ride or the more reliable you want that ride to be, the more it\u2019ll cost us.\nIf you say, \u201cYou know what? I may not need my ride in the next four minutes. I can wait 15 minutes. Or instead of having the car come all the way to me, I can walk two blocks if that makes the network more affordable or I can save money,\u201d then that\u2019s a trade-off you can make. Human beings are always trading off. Essentially you\u2019re paying for your time. With our network, there\u2019s always a trade-off between reliability / time and price.\u00a0\nSo, what we\u2019re trying to do is find products that allow people to self-identify where they want that trade-off. For example, you have a really important trip and are going to take a flight. You need to absolutely know that the Uber is going to be there. You can pick a reserve. You pay a premium for that reserve. The driver shows up early. The reliability is like over 99 percent. That\u2019s one version.\u00a0\nThe other version is for the commuter. This is someone who is going to work every single day using Uber. The price of your commute every day can get up there. So, what we wanted to do is allow somebody to trade off a little bit of price for reliability. For example, we have one product called Routematch, which has set routes coming every 20 minutes, so there\u2019s predictability there. You will share your ride with up to two other people, but you are trading off a little bit. You can\u2019t quite get your ride on demand because there\u2019s a schedule there, and you may share with somebody. You\u2019re trading off a little bit of that personal reliability or time in order to get about 50 percent off.\nSo, we\u2019re constantly making trade-offs as it relates to our services. Originally, when we were thinking about these trade-offs, we thought it was about the demo. There are some people who are less time sensitive and more price sensitive or the other way around. It turns out that that is true, but there are also occasions. An occasion might be travel, where you\u2019re going to pay more to be more reliable. There may be another occasion where if you know the 20-minute increments, you can adjust your life to get that 50 percent off on your commute. So it\u2019s been a really interesting evolution and how we think about the trade-offs and the efficiencies of the network.\nIs convenience on that list of priorities for you? You talked about time and reliability, but it seems like if I open the app, it being inexpensive and right there is as important as all the other stuff.\nI think your definition of convenience may be different. Something that\u2019s cheaper may be more convenient for a person. Something that\u2019s more timely can be more convenient for another. Ultimately, I think convenience is an amalgamation of all of that and it depends on what you consider to be convenient.\nOne of the reasons I asked that question is because in various other parts of the tech industry that we cover, consumers will pick convenience over quality almost every time. The example I use, which is not a one-to-one to Uber, is music. Consumers will pick just the worst quality streaming if it\u2019s available. They\u2019ll watch bootleg YouTube videos of the songs they want to hear. They often will not pay for the high-quality lossless elsewhere. And you can do price discrimination based on that.\nI challenge you a little bit on that because in the early days, bootleg music, bootleg movies, etc. were the biggest use case. But actually as streaming made it more convenient, people were willing to pay. So I do think there\u2019s a price / convenience trade-off and it\u2019s personal. I think habits change as well. We are just trying to figure out what\u2019s the most optimal price / convenience trade-off that we can make to aggregate the most demand and the most supply.\nOne of the reasons I asked about convenience is that you framed Route Share or walking a little bit to get to the spot as reliability. To me it\u2019s actually convenience. I\u2019m going to trade a little bit of convenience and maybe pay a lot less.\nYou can totally go there.\nI read this press release announcing Route Share, and I had this very mid-2010s reaction, which was what if Uber just invented a bus. Did you just invent a bus?\nI think to some extent it\u2019s inspired by the bus. If you step back a little bit, a part of us looking to expand and grow is about making Uber more affordable to more people. I think one of the things that makes tech companies different from most companies out there is that our goal is to lower prices. If we lower the price, then we can extend the audience.\nThere are two ways of lowering price as it relates to Route Share. One is you get more than one person to share a car because cars cost money, drivers\u2019 time costs money, etc., or you reduce the size or price of the vehicle. And we\u2019re doing that actively. For example, with two-wheelers and three-wheelers in a lot of countries. We\u2019ve been going after this shared concept, which is a bus, for many, many years. We started with UberX Share, for example, which is on-demand sharing.\nBut this concept takes it to the next level. If you schedule and create consistency among routes, then I think we can up the matching quotient, so to speak, and then essentially pass the savings on to the consumer. So, call it a next-gen bus, but the goal is just to reduce prices to the consumer and then help with congestion and the environment. That\u2019s all good as well.\nCongestion is interesting. We\u2019re talking in New York City. We\u2019re a few months into the congestion pricing program, which was designed to get people out of their cars and onto the bus, mass transit, even into Ubers and taxis. Have you seen any statistics since congestion pricing has been in effect that says Uber usage has gone up?\nSo Uber usage has gone up, but we don\u2019t have the counterfactual. Would it have gone up if there were no congestion pricing? But what we\u2019re seeing is very similar to some of the public data out there, which says traffic is flowing faster. I think The New York Times said traffic speeds were up like 6 or 7 percent. Uber has very similar numbers as well.\nSo, Ubers are getting there faster, but I don\u2019t have a counterfactual. Was it good or bad for our business? We supported congestion pricing. The way I think about it is that it\u2019s actually taking cars or vehicles that have the lowest utility off the road. It\u2019s a little bit like surge pricing if you think about it, where during peak times, we want to get more drivers out there.\nAt the same time, we want to encourage people who may not need to travel during peak times. We actually want to dampen demand and move it to non-peak times. So, congestion pricing to some extent is a \u201ccity surge.\u201d They\u2019re increasing prices for a certain time, and it removes demand for vehicles that have the lowest utilization. It just so happens that Uber\u2019s taxis are very high utility vehicles on the road.\nYou\u2019re closing in on a decade as the CEO of Uber. The way you talk is very operational. You\u2019re maximizing the utility of these assets on the road, whether your drivers own them (we should talk about the autonomous fleets that seem like they\u2019re going to come into existence). Then, there\u2019s maximizing utility, value, and all this stuff. You took over from a founder who had a much grander vision, which was that no one should own a car and that all transportation should be run by Uber.\nWell, that\u2019s still a vision. Absolutely.\u00a0\nThe way you\u2019re talking about it, likeRoute Share competing with the bus, is it still the vision to take over from those things? Do you perceive yourself to be in competition with public transport?\nNo. Actually, I view that we are in competition with personal car ownership. That was Travis [Kalanick]\u2019s vision as well. Public transport is a teammate. Uber consistently does really well in cities where there\u2019s significant public transport because \u2014 and it goes to what I was talking about earlier \u2014 there are just different use cases. You might take public transport for your downtown commute, but if you\u2019re going to dinner with your friends, then you might take an Uber.\u00a0\nSo, Uber and public transport compete for a particular trip. That\u2019s absolutely true. You have to decide, \u201cAm I going to take the bus, am I going to take the subway, or am I going to take an Uber?\u201d As it relates to your life, we\u2019re very much complements.\u00a0\nThe big kahuna that we\u2019re going after is car ownership. That ultimately is a vision. It remains a vision. It\u2019s hard to do because the car is a really flexible product with mass manufacturing and it\u2019s really cost-effective. So, it\u2019s going to take a lot of work to get there. We\u2019re less than 3 percent of miles traveled on the road even though we\u2019re a very big company. We\u2019ve got a long way to go, but the vision definitely hasn\u2019t changed.\nAre there some markets where you think you\u2019ve made a bigger dent in car ownership than others?\nI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve made a bigger dent, but there are definitely some markets where our penetration of miles traveled is higher. For example, in Latin America, our penetration is very high. Penetration in New York or other big US cities where there is mass transit is higher as well. I haven\u2019t looked at whether we\u2019ve made a dent in ownership.\nAnother way to think about it is there\u2019s some percentage of people who would\u2019ve gotten a car but Uber exists in their life. Do you track that? Do you measure that?\nWe don\u2019t track that. But I can tell you \u2014 this drives me crazy. My son is over 18. I don\u2019t know about you but did you get a license the minute you could drive?\nOh yeah. At 15-and-a-half, in Wisconsin.\nExactly! It was just such a thing. It was a goal in life. It represented freedom. I\u2019m still trying to get my son to get his driver\u2019s license, but Uber\u2019s freed him up. If you look at the percentage of 16 or 18 year olds who are getting their license, that percentage is coming down significantly. I think it used to be two-thirds, but now it\u2019s probably in the 50 percent range. I could be wrong. So, it is absolutely having an effect on car ownership.\nDo you think that\u2019s a leading indicator for Uber success, or is that a lagging indicator of Fortnite success?\n[Laughs] Probably the two are mixed. I also think it\u2019s an indication of the urbanization of our populations, but I haven\u2019t actually looked into whether heavy Fortnite players are Uber users as well. I suspect they may be. Certainly Uber Eats users.\nI\u2019m going to leave that one alone. There\u2019s another hour of PhD-level sociology in that comment alone.\nCorrelation, causation, who knows.\nLet\u2019s talk about Uber itself. You took over in 2017. You took over a company led by a very strong founder who had a vision of how the company should be run. How is Uber structured at this point? This is a classic Decoder question.\nWe have a combination matrix and line of business structure, so we have two global leads: one for our mobility business and one for our delivery business. Then, most of the other functions \u2014 marketing and PR, government relations, product finance, etc. \u2014\u00a0 are matrixed. I would say that as the company has matured, we have matrixed more, which I think happens to a lot of companies that mature. Their practices become more predictable and they\u2019re trying to bring a higher degree of expertise into those practices. So, it\u2019s a combination. We constantly have this creative battle between the lines of businesses and the matrices. Ultimately, I think it works.\nI mean, that\u2019s the tension. I think the listeners know that the secret of the show is I can just guess at 80 percent of the problems if you tell me the structure of the company.\nListen, I think that the conflict is constructive. This is a terrible metaphor, but if you look at purebred dogs, they tend to get sick more, like bulldogs that have been bred year after year after year, versus hybrids that aren\u2019t pure breeds. To some extent, I think that companies that have a structure that\u2019s one note \u2014\u00a0 there\u2019s a line of business (LOB) structure or a matrix-only structure \u2014 there\u2019s a lack of conflict that sometimes allows the strength of the weakness of either structure to go overboard. Matrix structures are usually associated with more efficiency, but slower decision making. LOB are sometimes much faster but have difficulty scaling.\u00a0\nI think my directs and some of the teams get frustrated with conflict. Some of these decisions come up to me. But I think the conflict is actually really healthy. The conflict is what allows us to not fall prey because these two teams are constantly keeping each other in check. If you\u2019ve got a matrix function, it may not realize that, let\u2019s say, the marketing in Egypt is not sharp enough, but the Egypt GM is living and dying by that marketing. So the two keep each other in balance. That Egypt GM might not know what an absolutely first-rate marketer is. That conflict keeps those two in check and ultimately gets a better outcome. Conflict can be unpleasant, but I think the fight makes us better.\nAs a guy who runs a single vertical line of business in a matrix company, I understand what you\u2019re saying.\nThere\u2019s no perfect way.\nPut that into practice. You have a hypothetical there. What\u2019s an example where you have had to mediate that conflict?\nI think marketing is one, since we just talked about that. I\u2019ve had to mediate as it relates to, let\u2019s say, the allocation of capital. Every single line of business and GM is going to want some budget for branding because they\u2019re fighting it out on the ground. Then, if you look on a global basis, how do you allocate that marketing spend? The answer to the global solution may be different than the answer to the request of that Egypt GM. Those answers during planning may be different.\u00a0\nEarly on as we were building this matrix structure, there was a lot of conflict. Now, the teams have a real understanding. They\u2019re getting into a rhythm, and the conflicts get to me much less often. Same thing with product. Product prioritization is very similar, with a constant push and pull.\nAs a global company, you want to build globalized products that are as similar to each other as possible. At the same time, there are local competitors that may have some product twists and turns that may be only applicable to that market and\u00a0 may not make sense for you to build on a global basis. That push and pull is a tough one sometimes.\nWhen I say 80 percent of the problems, that\u2019s the one I can usually guess at with 100 percent accuracy. How do you solve that? Do you have local product teams that are allowed to just make Uber whatever they want?\nWe have the GMs on the ground who really keep the product teams accountable, but our product planning is global by nature and it is not perfect. Sometimes the GMs who yell the loudest get their way. We want to make sure that our product people travel to the market so they feel the pain of the market, so to speak. Honestly, it\u2019s something we have to keep working on. We don\u2019t have it perfect by any means.\nThere\u2019s a difference there from the founder-led company that is totally functional at the beginning with gobs of VC money coming in. I mean, that\u2019s the early Uber, right? We have a bunch of zero-interest-rate VC money and we\u2019re going to win by just buying all the drivers in a market, setting the prices to zero, and we\u2019ll figure it out in the end. And that was totally functional. You\u2019ve created it in a different structure. I\u2019m just wondering, how did you make that transition?\nLet me correct you there. It wasn\u2019t functional. It was GM-led.\nEven back in the day?\nThe GMs were mini CEOs of every single country. Travis would hire a GM and parachute them into a market. You\u2019re right that we did go out and buy supply. As a company, we really are supply-led, where first you build liquid supply and then you invest in demand. In the early days, you essentially had to price under market and lose a bunch of money.\nAs liquidity increases, the matches increase, and the efficiency of the market increases, you can start pulling more profits from a marketplace. That was essentially the formula. It might\u2019ve seemed crazy at the time, but I think that Travis and the founding team got it right. Creating liquidity in the marketplace is exactly what allows you to get to profitability. Whoever created the liquidity supply and demand fastest was the one who ultimately won.\u00a0\nSo in the early days, it was all GMs spending a ton of money on liquidity. When I came in, I started to globalize some of those matrix functions. It took time. It was painful at times, but I think we\u2019re at the right balance now.\nWhat\u2019s the hardest choice you had to make along that way?\nThe hardest choice was actually on product. Specifically, when I was around for a while, our Rides and Eats businesses were complete verticals. So you had different ops teams, different marketing teams, and different product teams. Eats was competing against pure plays: DoorDash, Just Eat, Deliveroo, etc. Eats was 10 or 15 percent of the business.\nSo if you decide to matrix that function, for example, is your head of product going to spend time on the 85 percent for Rides or are they going to spend time on the 15 percent for Eats? And no matter how much I said, \u201cHey, spend time on Eats,\u201d they were getting paid for Ride\u2019s success. So, we went a few years with Rides and Eats essentially being totally separate.\u00a0\nThen, there was a big decision that we made to combine the product teams and the product and tech teams. That\u2019s what makes the company go. There\u2019s a lot more that happens around it, but if you don\u2019t have great product or you\u2019re not strong technically, you\u2019re going to suffer. That decision was probably the hardest decision. It came with some bumps and bruises, but I think it was a really, really good decision. For one, Eats got big enough for everybody in the company to care about it, once it got past that 15 percent.\u00a0\nSecond, we were late to the game with Eats. We were years behind the other pure players. So if you ask yourself, \u201cWhy is Eats going to win?,\u201d we obviously had great talent, but you have to assume your competitors have great talent as well. The answer was the platform. Uber as a brand was an everyday use case, and you could actually introduce your audience who are using Rides on a daily basis to Eats. We then launched a membership program that worked for both.\u00a0\nThe platform and the fact that we have greater scale than anyone else allows us to invest more and then cross-sell our riders into eaters. Now more are eaters into riders. Then, encourage drivers to move people but also move things every once in a while.\nI want to ask you about cross-selling on the platform in a very specific way. but you\u2019ve walked right into the other big Decoder question I ask everybody, which is about decisions. You just described a big decision. What\u2019s your framework for making decisions?\nOne framework that I use is, \u201cis it a one-way door or a two-way door?\u201d That\u2019s classic Amazon. I think Jeff Bezos introduced it. It\u2019s a great framework.\nOne day we\u2019re going to make a supercut of people saying that on the show.\nSo many people have been impacted by him, and deservedly so. He\u2019s one of the great CEOs of the world. Just make the decision. Use your instinct. It\u2019s always a two-way door, that\u2019s easy. But that\u2019s an example of a one-way door.\nYou mean merging the product teams?\nYeah, merging the product teams. You\u2019ve got to go for it. I can\u2019t tell you that there was a perfect construct one way or the other. At some point, you have to make some of these decisions based on instinct. One of the constructs is what do you have to believe so that the outcome of what you\u2019re doing today is going to change? So, if I keep doing the same thing but I do it an inch and a half better, am I going to get to the Promised Land? Is that just going to take way too much time, or is there uncertainty in getting there where I need a shock to the system?\u00a0\nAs it relates to Eats, we did unbelievably well in the early days, but there was a point where we were hitting a ceiling. It was then where I decided that to get to that next level, we actually need a shock to the system, and we changed our organizational structure.\nIn hindsight, I think it was a really good decision, not necessarily because of the product side. We still have dedicated Rides and Eats product leaders. It was actually more on the engineering side, on the code base. It allowed our engineers to generalize a code base to take some of, let\u2019s say, our marketplace talent from Rides, who were second to none, and move them over to Eats.\nIt\u2019ll take a little while, but I\u2019ll give you a quick example of some of these unanticipated benefits. When you order an Uber ride, we essentially have to scan the market for all the cars out there and where they\u2019re going, and are they available or not available. We have to match you to a car, and we\u2019ve got to price that ride in less than 30 seconds. We want the ETA to be four or five minutes, and so we have very, very little time to make that decision.\u00a0\nSo, the algorithms that are running have to work very quickly. They\u2019re making tens of millions of predictions per second. Make that match and go. That takes certain architecture and a bunch of compute. With Eats, we have the average time to make food at like 10 to 12 minutes. So, you have a lot more time to make that match.\u00a0\nBut we had to make all the same calculus. Where is the courier? Which courier should I match you with? How do I price you? The time with which we had to make the match on the courier side was much longer. So we would recalc the marketplace in two or three minutes. With Eats, we essentially make a bid to a courier who can accept the delivery or not. Let\u2019s say for a delivery that I\u2019ve got three bids I can make before the food gets cold. My first bid might be $6. If they said no, the second bid may be $7. If they said \u201cNo, I really have to get you the food,\u201d the third bid might be $10. Once we switched the teams over, the Rides team said, \u201cOh no, we can make this recalc in 15 seconds.\u201d\nNow, we\u2019ve got the ability to make 10 bids. So instead of going from six to seven to 10, you go from $6 to $6.50, $6.75, $7. So the ultimate cost per transaction is lower just because of compute, speed of algorithms, and decision-making. I didn\u2019t anticipate that when I made the switch, but those kinds of benefits \u2014 in terms of back end code, engineering, just scale \u2014 were actually the biggest we saw.\nI understand why that\u2019s great for me as a customer because cost comes down. I understand why it\u2019s great for Uber because the margin goes up. Is that good for the courier?\nWell, the couriers get more business. For example, our ability to make more bids has allowed us to increase the number of batches. So now the courier is carrying two goods and gets tipped twice close to 50 percent of the time. That was a side benefit for the courier as well, which we think ultimately helps earnings.\nThe way you\u2019re describing Uber is as a platform. A lot of the announcements are about using it more as a platform: \u201cEngage with us more often in your life.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a kind of cold platform, but it\u2019s an everyday use case.\nThe reason I ask about this is because maybe 60 percent of the interviews I\u2019ve done on Decoder this year are people telling me they\u2019re going to build AI agents. You\u2019re just going to talk to the computer and the Toyota Camry is going to show up.\nAI is a cool thing.\nEveryone is telling me this is going to happen in ways big and small, whether we\u2019re building Model Context Protocol applications at the bleeding edge of tech standards or whether we\u2019re just going to click around on your website using a testing tool, which is a real product that exists in this world. And Uber has been clicked around by these products.\nThose all disintermediate your platform. You have to do the hard work of creating liquidity of supply and making sure the Toyota Camry appears, and they own the customer relationship. Why would you ever participate in this? I ask them all this question. They\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. The market will figure it out.\u201d I\u2019m like, that\u2019s you! You\u2019re the market. But you\u2019re the other side of the market. Would you participate?\nIt\u2019s a really good question. We talk about it all the time, and time will tell as to what the right decision is. I believe in running open platforms. I don\u2019t believe in companies that try to fight the course that technology is taking. They always get left behind. I think we should go to where consumers want us to go. I do think that\u2019s all nicey-nicey, but at the same time, one of the advantages that we have is our unique inventory.\nEssentially, we\u2019ve got 8.5 million drivers and couriers and over 1.2 million merchants out there. It\u2019s very difficult for a company that has an agent to disintermediate us and go direct to the almost 10 million pieces of inventory, if you want to be impersonal. These are people, these are businesses. It\u2019s very difficult for them to draw that inventory. While you may make your inventory available to these agents, you can charge a toll if you have unique inventory. So, if the agents bring us more demand, which means\u00a0 more orders for our restaurant partners or more rides for our drivers, that\u2019s worth something for us.\nAt the same time, because we\u2019re becoming more and more of an everyday use case \u2014 the frequency of our average user is six times a month and it continues to increase \u2014 we can create our own local agents. We know it\u2019s your commute time, so why don\u2019t we get you a car? Maybe we can actually make a dispatch to the car before you actually push the button to get it because we can predict that you\u2019re going to do it.\nSo I think, as it relates to AI and these agents, we want to work with these players. We come from a place of strength because of the unique inventory and the fragmentation of these markets that we\u2019re organizing. We\u2019re going to build our own agents as well. As long as we\u2019re thinking about the consumer, our earners, and our merchants, I think we\u2019ll be okay.\nLet\u2019s say I start Nilay\u2019s Model Company with Nilay\u2019s Voice Assistant, and I want to get people sandwiches. I want you to be able to say, \u201cI need to go to the airport, get me a car. Go read my email, figure out when my flight is, schedule a car.\u201d This is the dream. For some reason, we\u2019ve got to throw giant data centers at this problem. This is what they pitch me.\u00a0\nSo, I come to you and I say, \u201cI want to be able to get cars from Uber.\u201d What is the percentage toll? What is the extra margin you would have to charge me, in dollars and cents, to make it worth it for me to take the customer away from you in that way? Because when the customer opens your app, you get to cross-sell them into Uber One or ask if they would like some food when they arrive. There\u2019s all these other incremental opportunities that you would forego if I take that customer.\nSo I have a weird philosophy on this. Initially, I charge you zero. I think that companies sometimes\u2013\nAlarm bells just went off at every level.\nNo, listen! People spend so much time trying to figure out what the economics might be when the first thing is to try it out. Is it going to be a good experience or not? Is your scheduling actually going to work, or is it going to be off and the driver has to wait for 10 minutes, which is terrible? Let\u2019s just figure it out. Then, once you optimize the experience, we can measure. Are you an incremental consumer for Uber or are you totally cannibalistic?\nIf it\u2019s cannibalistic, then I\u2019m going to charge a lot of money. You can\u2019t have any money because you\u2019re getting the benefit and my content. You\u2019re not bringing me any business at all. If it is incremental, then I would pay some take rate. Is it a 5 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent take rate? It depends on the incrementality.\u00a0\nBut I think so much innovation has slowed down because companies try to figure out the economics first. Figure out the experience first and then the economics. Listen, if I do a bad deal for a year, who cares? I\u2019m going to renegotiate with you. I\u2019m building stuff for the next 10 years. Success or failure isn\u2019t going to be determined by my take rate being 5 or 20 percent in year one. It can set precedent, and precedents are dangerous. That\u2019s why I would say to charge zero. Let\u2019s try it out. Let\u2019s see what the experience is. Let\u2019s try to measure out what the value add is, and then the economics will take care of themselves.\nYou said you\u2019re having these conversations a lot internally at Uber. What is the shape of those conversations? Are there partners you\u2019re excited to work with? Are there agents you\u2019ve seen that are promising?\nWe\u2019re working with a number of players. I\u2019d say OpenAI is probably the top player we\u2019re working with as it relates to agents. It\u2019s imperfect. It\u2019s really early. The volume is tiny right now. The work is just to make the experience really great. It\u2019s way too early for me to tell you if it\u2019s going to work or not. Eventually it will, but I don\u2019t know the shape right now, so I want to experiment.\nWhen you think about that particular future, everybody wants this product. Again, 60 percent of my conversations are people just dreaming of a future where you talk to the robots and the robots go do stuff for you.\nNot a bad future.\nThat implies a lot of things. At the very beginning, it implies that Uber exists so you even have an API for you to go ask for a car from. At the base layer of that it implies that Toyota exists, and that there are literally vehicles with an effectively standardized service, support, and maintenance network around the world. The Toyota Camry is an atomic unit of transportation across the entire world, and that\u2019s an amazing thing that you depend on so that people can talk to the robot and the car will show up.\nThere\u2019s another change happening here that I think is fascinating, which is the move to autonomous vehicles and fleet operators for those vehicles. You are a participant in that with Waymo in Atlanta and Austin. Part of your recent announcement here is that VW is going to launch in Los Angeles with you guys next year.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s going to change the dynamics of those cars completely. You don\u2019t have independent contractors with the Toyota Camry atomic unit that you don\u2019t have to worry about. Where do we get wheels for a Toyota Camry? It\u2019s just not a problem that Uber has to solve. Cars start driving themselves and suddenly, a lot of people have to worry about different things. How do you think that\u2019s going to change while the agents are coming for you?\nOh my god, now you\u2019ve added agents to the mix.\nAt the end of the day, I think what you really want to do is say, \u201cI need a car,\u201d and then there\u2019s just a network of autonomous vehicles waiting to accept bids.\nI think you\u2019re correlating two things that I would separate. I was trained as an engineer, and you want to separate and simplify the two problems, although they may interact in certain ways. We talked about agents. If I bring value in by creating inventory for that agent, the value\u2019s going to be determined based on whether that demand for the agent is incremental or not. If it\u2019s not incremental, the value\u2019s really small, which means the content provider should get the vast majority of the economics. If it is incremental, then we\u2019ll talk about the value of that incrementality.\u00a0\nNow, when you look at autonomous vehicles, you\u2019re essentially replacing the driver with a machine. Our everyday drivers not only drive. That\u2019s their main job, but they usually own the car, refuel the car, clean the car, etc. So you have to replace that work set. First is the software layer. Waymo is working on it, there\u2019s VW. There are tons of different companies, like Pony and WeRide, that are working on that. We want to work with all the software providers, make sure they\u2019re safe and affordable, and bring them to market.\u00a0\nSecond is the car itself. The car can\u2019t just be a good, old-fashioned car. It has to be a super car. It\u2019s wheels but also a sensor kit. It needs much, much more compute to work, and the cost of that hardware right now is inordinately expensive. But it will come down after a couple of generations. Then, you have fleet management, which we just talked about and involves cleaning cars, etc., and then fleet ownership as well. The manager may own the car or ultimately\u2026\u00a0 actually I think you\u2019re going to have car ownership by the Blackstones of the world. Right now, Marriott doesn\u2019t own any of its hotels. There are these entities called REITs that own the hotels. There will be fleets, with these financial companies and retirement pension funds owning big fleets of cars.\nOur job is going to be bringing demand to these really expensive cars. These AVs are so expensive, you\u2019re not going to have that many of them on the road in the early days. So, there will be a hybrid model like we have in Austin right now. If a Waymo happens to be close to you, we\u2019ll hail a Waymo. If the Waymo is 10 minutes away and there are a bunch of drivers who are really close, we\u2019ll get you a driver.\nThe percentage of AVs over a period of time is going to increase, and our job is going to be to manage that shift smoothly and make sure that the utilization, whether it\u2019s a Waymo or VW, is really high. Right now, what we\u2019re seeing in Austin is that the average Waymo is 99 percent more productive in terms of trips per day than the average driver. So we can really drive utilization.\u00a0\nUltimately, if the demand for that Waymo comes through the Uber app the old-fashioned way, through an Uber agent, or through an OpenAI or another agent, I don\u2019t think it really matters in terms of the autonomous transition. That\u2019s going to happen separately. We want to manage it. Where that demand comes from, whether agent, app, or something that we haven\u2019t imagined, that\u2019s a separate issue. So we just have to manage both transitions. I don\u2019t think the two are really going to conflict with each other.\nLet me try to make them conflict.\nAll right. I like it.\nYou have some big partners. I think a lot of people assumed Waymo would be a competitor, but you found ways to partner with them.\nI think they\u2019re a competitor and a partner. I\u2019ll give you an example. Domino\u2019s is a competitor to Uber Eats because sometimes people go directly to the Domino\u2019s app, and it\u2019s a partner at the same time. I think people look for the drama, like if you are with me or are you against me. The fact is that they work with us \u2014 coopetition or whatever you want to call it. Waymo\u2019s going to work with us in certain circumstances, and it\u2019s going to be looking to bring customers directly in others.\nRight, because you control a whole bunch of demand for their product.\nYes.\nThe one competitor I don\u2019t see making as pragmatic a decision as that is Tesla. We will see how [the Robotaxi] actually exists, but the way it has been described is it\u2019s going to take everyone\u2019s individually owned Teslas, flip on some software, and while you\u2019re sleeping, they\u2019re going to go off and drive at night.\nI have a lot of questions generally about where the demand in the middle of the night comes from, but so it goes. But that\u2019s a system where you suddenly increase a bunch of autonomous car inventory that is just floating around the city, and you can get demand by just saying, \u201cI need a car.\u201d Then, you have an individual unit of supply that\u2019s like, \u201cHere I am.\u201d You can build an entirely other system that does not require paying you a transaction fee.\u00a0\nThat does feel like how you can combine these two ideas because the individual operator of the Tesla Robotaxi might have a different approach. How do you reconcile that? Do you think Tesla\u2019s going to make that work? Do you think that all those people are going to end up turning over their houses to Airbnb management companies like Airbnb owners do?\nI think it remains to be seen. We have to take anything that Tesla does seriously. Elon Musk\u2019s an unbelievable entrepreneur. He\u2019s built so many companies. My thinking is that the individual owner of the Tesla is going to get a subset of demand if that demand can only come from Tesla. Then, he or she could get from Tesla demand plus Uber demand.\u00a0\nSo 10 years from now, every single Toyota comes with self-driving software. I think that is relatively likely. You can buy a Toyota and when you\u2019re asleep put that Toyota on Uber, which has unbelievable amounts of demand, and make X dollars per day. Or you can buy a Tesla and put it on the Tesla app, which I think is going to have less demand. Ultimately, if you\u2019re looking out for the owner and you want to allow them to monetize as much as possible, that owner\u2019s going to look for the most demand, which is actually going to drive them to multi-source.\nThis is why five years ago, Domino\u2019s was on its earnings calls saying, \u201cI\u2019m never going to use third-party apps,\u201d and it is now. Ultimately, it\u2019s a restaurant, and you want to monetize that restaurant as best you can, and having multiple platforms feeding that restaurant, so to speak, is mathematically the best way. So, I\u2019m hoping that Tesla eventually decides, \u201cI can build my direct channel, but I can also work for Uber.\u201d That\u2019s ultimately best for Tesla owners.\nHave you talked to Tesla about collaborating in any way?\nWe talk to them all the time. I think there are 150,000 Teslas on the network. We\u2019d love to collaborate with them, and if they want to take us up on that, we\u2019re game.\nDo you think they can actually pull off the Robotaxi fleet as they\u2019ve described it?\nI don\u2019t know.\u00a0 From my standpoint \u2014 and this is judgment \u2014 you really need superhuman safety. Superhuman, to me, doesn\u2019t mean better than a human. It means five times better than a human. I think the data suggests that Waymo is around that level. It\u2019s not 100 percent clear to me whether camera-only can get there. Most of the players who are building this technology from the ground up are going with cameras and LiDAR to have redundancy as it relates to perception. If Tesla can do it, more power to them. We\u2019ll see. I think time will tell.\nThe thing that I think about is what I already mentioned, which is that I know what kind of riders exist in the middle of the night. I was one of those riders in my 20s, and it just seems like there\u2019s going to be an awful lot of puke in an awful lot of Teslas.\nThere\u2019s a lot that drivers do that we take for granted. There\u2019s a lot of work.\nHow do you manage that with your autonomous fleet now? Somebody gets sick in the car, somebody makes a mess in the car, and you don\u2019t know about it until the next rider shows up.\nThat\u2019s something that you have to handle, which is a rider complaint, or you might have cameras inside the car, for example. The newer cars have that.\nDo you make an AI puke detector?\nI guess we\u2019re going to have to build that. That\u2019s going to go into our product roadmap.\nSmell-O-Vision in the car to make sure.\nThat\u2019s an interesting one, but that essentially is going to be the job of the fleet operator.\nHow does that cut work with the fleet operator? I took an Uber to work today. I figured I should use your app before I talked to you. I asked the driver and he said, \u201cI want my rates to go up.\u201d Maybe every driver I\u2019ve ever talked to wants that.\nEveryone wants to make more money. Absolutely.\nThat\u2019s the driver\u2019s perspective. I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re going to make the rates go up with big fleet operators who now have giant fixed costs, are happy to have 24/7 utilization, and maybe take a lower rate for greater use while the drivers just want high rates. How do you square that circle? It feels like the driver rates are going to get pushed down as autonomy comes into the mix.\nOur job is going to be managing the balance between demand and supply. So, I think autonomy is actually going to drive more demand. Even though autonomous inventory is going to be an ever-increasing percentage of our overall inventory, the number of drivers that we need on our network over the next 5-10 years is going to increase because demand increases more, so to speak.\nTwenty years from now, you might be right. From that standpoint, we just have to manage our inventory. There\u2019s a turnover of drivers all the time, and we want to make sure that we give drivers the right earnings expectations. In a city where demand isn\u2019t growing because autonomous supply is coming in, maybe we just have to slow down driver recruitment and not make them promises as it relates to earnings.\nSo, I think communication, being straight with people, is the ultimate answer. But I don\u2019t take it for granted. This is going to be a transition that we have to manage very, very carefully and make sure that our driver base is taken care of.\nWhat do you think the deals with the fleet operators will look like? Maybe the entire thesis of The Verge is that adding computers to things makes them very complicated, and we should pay attention to that complexity. I\u2019ll use the Toyota Camry again, but with the Honda Accord or the Chevy Malibu my parents had in the \u201980s when I was a kid, you didn\u2019t have to update the software. They didn\u2019t have buffer overflows. The infotainment deck did not restart in the middle of the day.\nThey might have cranky mechanical issues, but again, there\u2019s an ecosystem to help fix that very quickly. If you get a flat tire in New York, you can just push the car around the corner and there\u2019s a taxi garage waiting for you. That\u2019s incredible. You\u2019ve got a bunch of cars that have tons and tons of software at the bleeding edge of technology, yet cameras can get dirty or broken or whatever. That\u2019s a different set of costs on top of the existing mechanical costs. You\u2019re not going to repair the robotic cars. The fleet managers are going to.\nWe actually work with fleet managers today, and the reason is that a bunch of drivers can\u2019t afford vehicles or can\u2019t get loans for vehicles. Companies can. Also, we\u2019re actively trying to electrify our vehicle base. Close to 10 percent of our vehicles are now electric, with more than 20 percent in certain cities in Europe. So, we have experience with fleet operators. About 15 percent of our volume comes from fleet operators. Many of those fleet operators own the cars. Not all fleet operators own the cars. I think if they own the cars, then they\u2019re just looking for a return on invested capital, and the return is going to depend on the risk. The more volume we bring them, then the cheaper the cars are going to be because utilization is going to be really, really high.\nThen, there are going to be some pure play fleet operators where the financial players are going to own the cars. That\u2019s going to look more like cost plus. So if it costs you $10 to operate the fleet, we\u2019ll pay you $11 or $12. Our philosophy right now, as I said earlier, is to make the damn thing work, make it safe, and then worry about the economics. AV loses money for us right now, but we know it\u2019s going to be huge in the future. It\u2019s going to ultimately bring the cost of our service down, and it\u2019s going to make the street safer. For us now, it\u2019s about making the system work, and then the economics are going to fall into place.\u00a0\nBut I think fleet operations will be a part of the ecosystem and they won\u2019t be the majority. What we will bring to these autonomous players is an end-to-end solution. So, they have to work on what they\u2019re really good at, which is self-driving algorithms, and then leave the rest up to us.\nBut it\u2019s that middle part that I\u2019m just focused on.\nWell, we work with these fleet operators. For example, one of our fleet partners is operating the Waymo fleet in Austin right now. Certain players may want to do the fleet operation themselves, but I think that our local on-the-ground expertise and the fact that we are running fleets with millions of cars today will be another benefit. I don\u2019t know if VW in LA is going to want to operate its own fleet. We will be able to bring that capability. If they want to do it themselves, that\u2019s totally fine as well.\nI think I\u2019m just stuck on that the fleet operators are going to have a bunch of really highly paid IT people sitting around rebooting the fiber optic networks of these cars.\nIf it\u2019s just the reboot, that\u2019ll be easy. Again, these are complex vehicles. The cost of the vehicles is really high right now, and the care for those vehicles is going to be not-zero.\nWhen you think about the safety side, which you\u2019ve talked about several times now, the question of autonomous liability exists in the world. I book a Waymo through Uber. The Waymo gets in an accident. Who accepts that liability today?\nWe think early on, most of the self-driving companies will self-insure. They\u2019re big companies. They can afford to self-insure. But ultimately, whether they insure, we insure, or the owners insure, it\u2019ll work itself out.\nWhat is the mechanism for working it out?\nLooking at the incident rate and looking at the cost per incident. I think incident rates are going to come way down, especially if these autonomous vehicles are superhuman safe. Cost per incident is going to go up, which is because the cars are much more expensive. But I think that the overall cost of insurance as a percentage of your ride is going to come way down because of the safety of these cars.\nWe\u2019re almost out of time here. I\u2019ve got to ask you the last question in honor of my Uber driver today. If you were to tell Uber drivers today, \u201cHere\u2019s how I will make you make more money,\u201d what would you say?\nI would say we\u2019re going to bring you more rides. The income for Uber drivers in New York, for example, is more than $50 per utilized hour. New York\u2019s an expensive place, but we think that\u2019s a pretty good trade-off for a job that brings lots and lots of flexibility. But it\u2019s a hard job, traffic is tough. So, we\u2019ll keep working on it. Ultimately, the way to offer more earnings to drivers is to bring more demand, and every single day we\u2019re working on that.\nDara, this is great.

However, you can simply start a new session immediately after. This deal will be active through July 6th, and after your six months are up, you\u2019ll be charged the full price unless you cancel beforehand.\nThis discount comes at an especially opportune time for Steam Deck owners, as the official GeForce Now should be launching soon for Valve\u2019s handheld, although an exact date hasn\u2019t been publicly confirmed. Now, it might seem kind of redundant to play Steam games via the cloud when you can simply load them onto a Steam Deck\u2019s storage, but Nvidia\u2019s virtual machines are more powerful.
