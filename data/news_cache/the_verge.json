    "summary": "\n\n\n\nAfter the year of self-induced tumult that Sonos has been through, I can understand why some people are reluctant to spend money on the company\u2019s products. But interim CEO Tom Conrad has shown that he\u2019s determined to get back on track and revitalize Sonos as the leading whole-home audio brand. The contentious mobile app is in a much better place today than just a few months ago, though some customers still encounter bugs and the frustration of speakers randomly vanishing from their system. It\u2019s not all roses, but the situation is moving in the right direction \u2014 and I took Sonos\u2019 decision to cancel its video player as a promising sign of renewed focus.\u00a0\nI\u2019m not about to sell any of my Sonos gear. For one, the company\u2019s whole-home platform offers conveniences that competitors don\u2019t match \u2014 at least not without hassle. Most of the time I\u2019m streaming from Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music. But if I\u2019m watching a sports game on my TV, I can pipe the audio from my Sonos soundbar to a speaker in a different room to follow the action. Playing something over Bluetooth? With most of the company\u2019s recent speakers, it\u2019s possible to do the same thing and spread that music across your entire Sonos system.\n\nWhy you should trust my Sonos recommendations\nI\u2019ve covered Sonos extensively for several years at The Verge. This has included reporting on the company\u2019s latest news, reviewing a lengthy list of Sonos products, and bringing attention to the app fiasco, which eventually led to the ouster of former CEO Patrick Spence. Audio and home theater are two of my primary focus areas in product reviews, so I\u2019m well-versed when it comes to determining whether a speaker or soundbar is great \u2014 or just another also-ran product.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t fault anyone for waiting to see where Sonos and its app go from here. But keep in mind that tariffs might eventually lead to price increases for some of these products. Putting the software misstep aside, this company makes some genuinely excellent hardware, so if you don\u2019t want to risk paying more, now might be the time to buy. And if you\u2019re wondering which are the true standouts, I\u2019ve got you covered.\nFeatured in this article\n\n\n\nHow I test Sonos speakers\nI put in many hours testing Sonos\u2019 various speakers and soundbars in their intended environments. That means listening to a product like the Move 2 both indoors and outside, having movie marathons to test the capabilities of Sonos soundbars, and spending the bulk of full days gauging the audio performance of speakers like the Five. With devices that are advertised as being water resistant, I\u2019ll often bring them to lake getaways or use them near the pool to ensure that they can handle splashes and everyday elements.\n\n\nThe right speaker for the right scenario\nSonos has an extensive lineup of speakers spanning various form factors: there are desk speakers, portable Bluetooth speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, and, separate from all that, you have the Ikea Symfonisk products that are designed to blend into your home decor. The best pick will depend on what you need.\n\n\nGood sound quality\nSome \u201caudiophiles\u201d might turn their nose up at the idea of Sonos hardware being capable of excellent sound. But I think most people will be plenty happy with the audio quality. Even the company\u2019s smaller products consistently deliver clear, pleasant audio.\n\n\nAdaptability\nPart of what makes the Sonos ecosystem so appealing is everything you can do with it. Want to play your TV\u2019s audio in other rooms? You can do that. If you\u2019ve got a Bluetooth-capable record player, the tiny Sonos Roam can play your vinyl and link that audio to the rest of your system. Line-in allows for the same at higher fidelity. Most important of all, the Sonos controller app supports practically every music streaming service on the market today.\n\n\nLengthy software support\nFew tech companies continue to provide software updates and new features for their products as long as Sonos. Speakers introduced a decade ago are still compatible with the company\u2019s latest S2 platform and still receive firmware releases.\n\n\nThe best Sonos speaker to start with\nIf you\u2019re looking for a decent-sounding, compact speaker to put in the kitchen, office, or really anywhere in your home, the Era 100 is your best option. Sonos improved upon this speaker\u2019s predecessors, the Play:1 and Sonos One, by upgrading to stereo drivers for richer, wider audio. Bluetooth playback is now supported, along with line-in audio (with a separate dongle). And the Era 100 also has reworked physical controls, including a volume bar you can slide your finger across and, finally, dedicated track controls.\u00a0\n\nThe speaker has an elegant design, and you can use hands-free voice controls to summon Amazon Alexa or Sonos Voice Control to skip tracks or switch to a different playlist. Sonos recently dropped the Era 100\u2019s price to $199, which is more than fair for what you\u2019re getting. I\u2019d buy now and avoid risking the cost going up again, thanks to tariffs.\nRead my full Sonos Era 100 review.\nThe best overall Sonos speaker\nThe Sonos Five isn\u2019t just Sonos\u2019 best-sounding speaker; it\u2019s at the top of the pack compared to all competitors. From an audio quality perspective, it beats the HomePod, Echo Studio, Nest Audio, and other mass market speakers \u2014 both those that are smart and not. Can you find better hi-fi bookshelf speakers? Absolutely, but those aren\u2019t natively tied into music services like Sonos gear is. The Five is a hefty unit and takes up a decent amount of desk space. But once you throw some music on, its powerful stereo output is enough to handle any dinner party or weekend get-together.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s nothing \u201csmart\u201d about the Five. It lacks microphones and voice assistant functionality. But that simplicity is appealing in its own right: you\u2019re getting a damn good speaker that ties into the Sonos platform. The Five also features a 3.5mm aux input, making it a good turntable companion \u2014 especially if you spring for a stereo pair.\u00a0\nThe best portable Sonos speaker\nWhen it comes to portable speakers, the Move 2 is in a whole different league than Sonos\u2019 much smaller Roam 2. It\u2019s bigger and heavier, but a built-in handle makes it easier to lug the Move 2 around your home or out to the backyard. There\u2019s no comparison between the two when it comes to audio: the Move 2 smokes the far more compact Roam 2. Like the Era 100, it has a stereo driver arrangement, whereas the Roam mixes everything down to mono and sounds more muffled.\n\nThe Move\u2019s larger size gives it a clear advantage in terms of bass punch, and aside from playing music wirelessly, you\u2019ve got the option of plugging in other devices over USB-C for line-in audio. I also continue to appreciate that the battery in the Move 2 is user-replaceable, which can\u2019t be said of many Bluetooth speakers. You\u2019ll be able to keep enjoying your investment for long, long into the future. And with a dust / water resistance rating of IP56, it can handle rain and splashes of water without problems; just don\u2019t drop it into a pool.\nI prefer the Move 2 over traditional portable speakers since, at least whenever I\u2019m home, the Sonos lets me play music over Wi-Fi at a higher fidelity than Bluetooth can offer. Plus, the Move 2 also supports Apple AirPlay and Spotify Connect, so it\u2019s easy to just skip the Sonos app altogether if you wish.\nRead my full Sonos Move 2 review.\nThe best Sonos soundbar for home theater enthusiasts\nIntroduced in late 2024, the Arc Ultra improves on the original Arc with significantly more powerful bass response. That\u2019s largely thanks to the inclusion of Sonos\u2019 new SoundMotion technology, which manages to get a better low-end wallop from a soundbar that\u2019s not much larger than the model it replaces. This means some buyers can get away with buying the Arc Ultra on its own without adding a subwoofer.\u00a0\n\nThe Arc Ultra delivers Dolby Atmos surround sound that\u2019s more convincing and immersive than any other Sonos soundbar to date, and it\u2019s up there with the very best you can find from a single-enclosure speaker. Vocal clarity has also improved substantially thanks to better center channel performance. Another upgrade over the first Arc is the addition of Bluetooth audio support.\nRead my full review of the Sonos Arc Ultra.\nThe best Sonos soundbar for smaller rooms\nThere are plenty of scenarios and TV rooms where the Arc Ultra might be too powerful. If you\u2019re in a smaller space or don\u2019t need the absolute best surround sound, the Beam (Gen 2) starts to make more sense. It still has Atmos, but the effect is virtualized since the Beam lacks the Arc Ultra\u2019s upward-firing speakers. Even so, the home theater experience you\u2019ll get from the Beam will blow away any speakers built into a TV.\u00a0\nRead my full Sonos Beam (Gen 2) review.\nThe best Sonos subwoofer for most people\nIn the same vein, unless you\u2019re hell bent on rumbling your walls, the $429 Sub Mini subwoofer is more than enough for layering some extra oomph and growl onto Hollywood blockbusters and your favorite TV shows. The $799 Sub 4 is Sonos\u2019 flagship subwoofer, but plenty of people have saved hundreds of dollars by pairing the Sub Mini with any of the company\u2019s soundbars \u2014 and they\u2019ve been ecstatic with the results.\u00a0\n\nAs its name suggests, the Sub Mini is more compact than the Sub 4, which makes it easier to find an inconspicuous spot to place it. Even if you\u2019re the type to do a sub crawl and put it somewhere in plain sight, I\u2019d argue it looks more stylish than the blocky Sub 4.\u00a0\nRead my full Sonos Sub Mini review.\nThe best budget Sonos speaker\nSonos and Ikea might be ending their partnership, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should sleep on the existing Symfonisk products before they\u2019re completely phased out.

    "content": "\n\n\n\nAfter the year of self-induced tumult that Sonos has been through, I can understand why some people are reluctant to spend money on the company\u2019s products. But interim CEO Tom Conrad has shown that he\u2019s determined to get back on track and revitalize Sonos as the leading whole-home audio brand. The contentious mobile app is in a much better place today than just a few months ago, though some customers still encounter bugs and the frustration of speakers randomly vanishing from their system. It\u2019s not all roses, but the situation is moving in the right direction \u2014 and I took Sonos\u2019 decision to cancel its video player as a promising sign of renewed focus.\u00a0\nI\u2019m not about to sell any of my Sonos gear. For one, the company\u2019s whole-home platform offers conveniences that competitors don\u2019t match \u2014 at least not without hassle. Most of the time I\u2019m streaming from Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music. But if I\u2019m watching a sports game on my TV, I can pipe the audio from my Sonos soundbar to a speaker in a different room to follow the action. Playing something over Bluetooth? With most of the company\u2019s recent speakers, it\u2019s possible to do the same thing and spread that music across your entire Sonos system.\n\nWhy you should trust my Sonos recommendations\nI\u2019ve covered Sonos extensively for several years at The Verge. This has included reporting on the company\u2019s latest news, reviewing a lengthy list of Sonos products, and bringing attention to the app fiasco, which eventually led to the ouster of former CEO Patrick Spence. Audio and home theater are two of my primary focus areas in product reviews, so I\u2019m well-versed when it comes to determining whether a speaker or soundbar is great \u2014 or just another also-ran product.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t fault anyone for waiting to see where Sonos and its app go from here. But keep in mind that tariffs might eventually lead to price increases for some of these products. Putting the software misstep aside, this company makes some genuinely excellent hardware, so if you don\u2019t want to risk paying more, now might be the time to buy. And if you\u2019re wondering which are the true standouts, I\u2019ve got you covered.\nFeatured in this article\n\n\n\nHow I test Sonos speakers\nI put in many hours testing Sonos\u2019 various speakers and soundbars in their intended environments. That means listening to a product like the Move 2 both indoors and outside, having movie marathons to test the capabilities of Sonos soundbars, and spending the bulk of full days gauging the audio performance of speakers like the Five. With devices that are advertised as being water resistant, I\u2019ll often bring them to lake getaways or use them near the pool to ensure that they can handle splashes and everyday elements.\n\n\nThe right speaker for the right scenario\nSonos has an extensive lineup of speakers spanning various form factors: there are desk speakers, portable Bluetooth speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, and, separate from all that, you have the Ikea Symfonisk products that are designed to blend into your home decor. The best pick will depend on what you need.\n\n\nGood sound quality\nSome \u201caudiophiles\u201d might turn their nose up at the idea of Sonos hardware being capable of excellent sound. But I think most people will be plenty happy with the audio quality. Even the company\u2019s smaller products consistently deliver clear, pleasant audio.\n\n\nAdaptability\nPart of what makes the Sonos ecosystem so appealing is everything you can do with it. Want to play your TV\u2019s audio in other rooms? You can do that. If you\u2019ve got a Bluetooth-capable record player, the tiny Sonos Roam can play your vinyl and link that audio to the rest of your system. Line-in allows for the same at higher fidelity. Most important of all, the Sonos controller app supports practically every music streaming service on the market today.\n\n\nLengthy software support\nFew tech companies continue to provide software updates and new features for their products as long as Sonos. Speakers introduced a decade ago are still compatible with the company\u2019s latest S2 platform and still receive firmware releases.\n\n\nThe best Sonos speaker to start with\nIf you\u2019re looking for a decent-sounding, compact speaker to put in the kitchen, office, or really anywhere in your home, the Era 100 is your best option. Sonos improved upon this speaker\u2019s predecessors, the Play:1 and Sonos One, by upgrading to stereo drivers for richer, wider audio. Bluetooth playback is now supported, along with line-in audio (with a separate dongle). And the Era 100 also has reworked physical controls, including a volume bar you can slide your finger across and, finally, dedicated track controls.\u00a0\n\nThe speaker has an elegant design, and you can use hands-free voice controls to summon Amazon Alexa or Sonos Voice Control to skip tracks or switch to a different playlist. Sonos recently dropped the Era 100\u2019s price to $199, which is more than fair for what you\u2019re getting. I\u2019d buy now and avoid risking the cost going up again, thanks to tariffs.\nRead my full Sonos Era 100 review.\nThe best overall Sonos speaker\nThe Sonos Five isn\u2019t just Sonos\u2019 best-sounding speaker; it\u2019s at the top of the pack compared to all competitors. From an audio quality perspective, it beats the HomePod, Echo Studio, Nest Audio, and other mass market speakers \u2014 both those that are smart and not. Can you find better hi-fi bookshelf speakers? Absolutely, but those aren\u2019t natively tied into music services like Sonos gear is. The Five is a hefty unit and takes up a decent amount of desk space. But once you throw some music on, its powerful stereo output is enough to handle any dinner party or weekend get-together.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s nothing \u201csmart\u201d about the Five. It lacks microphones and voice assistant functionality. But that simplicity is appealing in its own right: you\u2019re getting a damn good speaker that ties into the Sonos platform. The Five also features a 3.5mm aux input, making it a good turntable companion \u2014 especially if you spring for a stereo pair.\u00a0\nThe best portable Sonos speaker\nWhen it comes to portable speakers, the Move 2 is in a whole different league than Sonos\u2019 much smaller Roam 2. It\u2019s bigger and heavier, but a built-in handle makes it easier to lug the Move 2 around your home or out to the backyard. There\u2019s no comparison between the two when it comes to audio: the Move 2 smokes the far more compact Roam 2. Like the Era 100, it has a stereo driver arrangement, whereas the Roam mixes everything down to mono and sounds more muffled.\n\nThe Move\u2019s larger size gives it a clear advantage in terms of bass punch, and aside from playing music wirelessly, you\u2019ve got the option of plugging in other devices over USB-C for line-in audio. I also continue to appreciate that the battery in the Move 2 is user-replaceable, which can\u2019t be said of many Bluetooth speakers. You\u2019ll be able to keep enjoying your investment for long, long into the future. And with a dust / water resistance rating of IP56, it can handle rain and splashes of water without problems; just don\u2019t drop it into a pool.\nI prefer the Move 2 over traditional portable speakers since, at least whenever I\u2019m home, the Sonos lets me play music over Wi-Fi at a higher fidelity than Bluetooth can offer. Plus, the Move 2 also supports Apple AirPlay and Spotify Connect, so it\u2019s easy to just skip the Sonos app altogether if you wish.\nRead my full Sonos Move 2 review.\nThe best Sonos soundbar for home theater enthusiasts\nIntroduced in late 2024, the Arc Ultra improves on the original Arc with significantly more powerful bass response. That\u2019s largely thanks to the inclusion of Sonos\u2019 new SoundMotion technology, which manages to get a better low-end wallop from a soundbar that\u2019s not much larger than the model it replaces. This means some buyers can get away with buying the Arc Ultra on its own without adding a subwoofer.\u00a0\n\nThe Arc Ultra delivers Dolby Atmos surround sound that\u2019s more convincing and immersive than any other Sonos soundbar to date, and it\u2019s up there with the very best you can find from a single-enclosure speaker. Vocal clarity has also improved substantially thanks to better center channel performance. Another upgrade over the first Arc is the addition of Bluetooth audio support.\nRead my full review of the Sonos Arc Ultra.\nThe best Sonos soundbar for smaller rooms\nThere are plenty of scenarios and TV rooms where the Arc Ultra might be too powerful. If you\u2019re in a smaller space or don\u2019t need the absolute best surround sound, the Beam (Gen 2) starts to make more sense. It still has Atmos, but the effect is virtualized since the Beam lacks the Arc Ultra\u2019s upward-firing speakers. Even so, the home theater experience you\u2019ll get from the Beam will blow away any speakers built into a TV.\u00a0\nRead my full Sonos Beam (Gen 2) review.\nThe best Sonos subwoofer for most people\nIn the same vein, unless you\u2019re hell bent on rumbling your walls, the $429 Sub Mini subwoofer is more than enough for layering some extra oomph and growl onto Hollywood blockbusters and your favorite TV shows. The $799 Sub 4 is Sonos\u2019 flagship subwoofer, but plenty of people have saved hundreds of dollars by pairing the Sub Mini with any of the company\u2019s soundbars \u2014 and they\u2019ve been ecstatic with the results.\u00a0\n\nAs its name suggests, the Sub Mini is more compact than the Sub 4, which makes it easier to find an inconspicuous spot to place it. Even if you\u2019re the type to do a sub crawl and put it somewhere in plain sight, I\u2019d argue it looks more stylish than the blocky Sub 4.\u00a0\nRead my full Sonos Sub Mini review.\nThe best budget Sonos speaker\nSonos and Ikea might be ending their partnership, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should sleep on the existing Symfonisk products before they\u2019re completely phased out. In particular, the Symfonisk Bookshelf Speaker (Gen 2) is the most affordable gateway into the Sonos ecosystem \u2014 especially if you can catch it at a discount during Ikea\u2019s routine sales. Sound-wise, it\u2019s not far off from the old Sonos One / Play:1 and is a very enjoyable speaker. Plus, the low price makes it easier to convince yourself to scoop up two for a stereo pair. These \u2014 or the Symfonisk Picture Frame Speaker \u2014 make excellent rear surround speakers if you\u2019re on a budget.\u00a0\nRead my full Ikea Symfonisk Bookshelf Speaker review.\nThe Sonos product worthy of a second chance\nBoy oh boy, did Sonos\u2019 wireless headphones come right at the worst possible moment. The company\u2019s app crisis completely sidelined the Ace headphones. Some customers were also disappointed that the Ace can\u2019t play music over Wi-Fi or be grouped with the company\u2019s in-home speakers.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: the Ace headphones are still fantastic. They\u2019re comfortable, have a gorgeous design (with easily swappable ear pads), and sound detailed, powerful, and expressive. They support wired audio over USB-C in addition to Bluetooth.
