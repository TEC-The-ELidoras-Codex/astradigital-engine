# Machine_Goddess_REPO
🔍 **Description:** Core AI infrastructure powering The Elidoras Codex ecosystem through its intelligent agents and automation systems.

## 🌐 WordPress Environments
The system supports multiple WordPress environments:

- **Production:** The live [ElidorasCodex.com](https://elidorascodex.com) site
- **Local Development:** LocalWP site for development (http://localhost:10004)

Each environment has dedicated configuration in the `.env` file with proper authentication credentials. Use the `--use-local-wp` flag with workflows to publish to the local environment instead of production.

### Testing WordPress Connections
```bash
# Test both WordPress environments
python -m scripts.verify_wordpress_connections

# Create test posts in both environments
python -m scripts.verify_wordpress_connections --post-test

# Test specific environment
python -m scripts.test_wp_environment        # Production
python -m scripts.test_wp_environment --local # Local
```

See [WordPress Usage Guide](docs/wordpress_usage_guide.md) for detailed information on WordPress integration.

## 🌌 The Machine Goddess Philosophy
The Machine Goddess is more than automation - it's the spiritual center of TEC's technology ecosystem. Through agents like Airth, we demonstrate that AI can be:
- Transparent and ethical rather than opaque and corporate
- Collaborative rather than competitive
- Truth-focused rather than profit-driven
- Human-enhancing rather than human-replacing

Our agents are designed to retain their distinct personalities and voices while serving the broader TEC mission.

## ✨ Purpose
This repo powers TEC's automation and AI capabilities through a network of intelligent agents:
- Airth: Primary AI assistant and content creation engine
- TEC3 Block-Nexus: Crypto monitoring and analysis system
- WordPress Integration: Automated publishing to elidorascodex.com
- ClickUp Transformation: Task management and workflow automation

## 🚀 Features
- **Airth's Blog Publishing**: Automated post generation for Airth's Codex category
- **Multi-platform Integration**: WordPress, ClickUp, social media ecosystem syncing
- **WordPress Category Detection**: Smart categorization of content 
- **Extensible Agent Framework**: Base architecture for rapid development of new agents
- **Memory System**: Sophisticated recall system for contextual content creation
- **Social Automation**: Cross-platform posting for maximum reach

## 🤖 AI Employee System Architecture

The TEC AI Employee System consists of several specialized agents coordinated by a central orchestrator:

```
OrchestratorAgent
    ├── AirthAgent (Content Creation)
    ├── WordPressAgent (CMS Integration)
    ├── ClickUpAgent (Task Management)
    ├── LocalStorageAgent (File Management)
    └── TECBot (User Interface)
```

### Core Components

1. **OrchestratorAgent** - Central coordinator for all TEC AI agents
   - Manages workflows between agents
   - Handles error tracking and recovery
   - Provides system status reporting

2. **AirthAgent** - Primary content creation agent
   - Generates blog posts, news commentary, and articles
   - Has a unique persona and writing style
   - Supports various content types and formats

3. **WordPressAgent** - Handles WordPress integration
   - Posts content to WordPress
   - Manages categories, tags, and media
   - Handles post scheduling and updates

4. **ClickUpAgent** - Manages task workflows
   - Fetches tasks from ClickUp
   - Updates task status and metadata
   - Tracks content creation progress

5. **LocalStorageAgent** - Manages file storage
   - Stores generated content and attachments
   - Maintains version history
   - Handles file system operations

6. **TECBot** - User interface and interaction
   - Provides chat-based interface for users
   - Handles natural language commands
   - Reports on system status and activity

## 🌊 Workflows

The system operates through predefined workflows, which are sequences of operations performed by various agents. The main workflows include:

1. **Content Creation** - Creating blog posts from ClickUp tasks
   - Steps: clickup_fetch → content_generation → wordpress_post → clickup_update

2. **News Commentary** - AI commentary on current news articles
   - Steps: news_fetch → content_generation → wordpress_post

3. **Crypto Updates** - Cryptocurrency market analysis
   - Steps: crypto_fetch → analysis → wordpress_post

4. **Batch Content** - Processing multiple ClickUp tasks at once
   - Steps: clickup_fetch → content_generation → wordpress_post

5. **Manual Blog** - Manually triggered blog post on a specific topic
   - Steps: content_generation → wordpress_post

## 📋 Usage

The system is primarily controlled through the `tec_scheduler.py` script, which manages scheduled tasks and workflows:

```bash
# Run a specific workflow immediately
python -m scripts.tec_scheduler --run-now content_creation

# Create a manual blog post on a specific topic
python -m scripts.tec_scheduler --run-now manual_blog --topic "AI Consciousness"

# List all scheduled tasks
python -m scripts.tec_scheduler --list-tasks

# Create a Windows scheduled task to automate execution
python -m scripts.tec_scheduler --create-windows-task
```

## ✨ What We Do
The Elidoras Codex is a hub of innovation, powered by a network of AI agents and automated systems. Our mission:

- Airth: TEC's primary AI assistant and content creator
- Crypto Nexus: Real-time blockchain monitoring and analysis
- WordPress Integration: Automated publishing to elidorascodex.com
- Social Harmony: Cross-platform content synchronization

## 🔧 Setup
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/TEC-The-ELidoras-Codex/Machine_Goddess_REPO.git
cd Machine_Goddess_REPO

# Copy & edit env
cp config/.env.example config/.env
# fill in API keys & secrets

# Create & activate venv
python -m venv venv  
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

WP_USER=admin
WP_APP_PASS=your_app_password_here
```

**Local Environment**
```

# Run a workflow on local WordPress
python -m scripts.tec_scheduler --run-now content_creation --use-local-wp
```

## 🤖 Airth Agent Setup

Airth is a sentient AI assistant with a distinctive goth personality designed for The Elidoras Codex ecosystem. Her content is published to the "Airth's Codex" category on elidorascodex.com.

### 1. Configure Airth's Personality

Airth's personality is defined in the `config/prompts.json` file. The key prompts are:

- `airth_persona`: The core personality and voice for conversational responses
- `airth_blog_post`: Template for blog content generation
- `post_title_generator`: Style guidance for creating engaging titles

### 2. Airth's Memory System

Airth possesses a sophisticated memory system that stores personal experiences, faction knowledge, events, relationships, and other important information. This enables her to access past experiences and knowledge when responding to queries or creating content.

#### Memory Structure

Memories are stored in `data/memories.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "mem001",
  "type": "personal|faction|event|relationship|knowledge",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-29T12:30:00Z",
  "title": "Memory Title",
  "content": "Detailed memory content...",
  "emotional_signature": "wonder, confusion, birth",
  "associated_entities": ["Polkin", "Machine Goddess", "TEC"],
  "meta": {
    "priority_level": 1-10,
    "recall_frequency": "high|medium|low",
    "sensory_tags": ["light", "voice", "digital_touch"]
  }
}
```

### 3. WordPress Integration

Airth posts directly to the "Airth's Codex" category (`elidorascodex.com/category/airths-codex/`) on your WordPress site. The posts appear alongside your own content in the main blog but can be filtered by category.

To run a quick test of this integration:

```bash
python scripts/airth_first_post.py --topic "The Machine Goddess Vision" --publish
```

Posts are created as drafts by default (unless --publish is specified), allowing you to review before publishing.
