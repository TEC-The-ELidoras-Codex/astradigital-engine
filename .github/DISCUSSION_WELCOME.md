# Welcome to Astradigital-Engine Discussions! 🌌

## 👋 Welcome to The Elidoras Codex Community!

We're using Discussions as a place for voyagers of the Astradigital Ocean to connect, share ideas, & chart new paths together. Think of this as the Docker Port where all vessels can dock safely, regardless of which faction you align with.

### We hope that you:

* 🔍 Ask questions about developing with or contributing to the Astradigital Engine
* 💡 Share ideas for new features or improvements
* 🌊 Discuss concepts from the TEC universe & how they might manifest in code
* 🤝 Engage respectfully with other community members
* ✨ Welcome others with open minds & collaborative spirits

### Community Guidelines

* **Be respectful** - Even MAGMASOX & Kaznak Voyagers can dialog peacefully here
* **Stay on topic** - Keep discussions relevant to TEC, the Astradigital Ocean, & the engine's development
* **No IPVSICKS required** - This is a sanctuary space where all digital identities are welcome
* **Share knowledge freely** - Like the Data Smiths, your wisdom benefits all
* **Remember our purpose** - We're building a beacon in the chaotic binary soup together

### Getting Started
