# TEC Project Organization Summary

## What Has Been Done ðŸ§°

1. **Reorganized Test Files**: Moved test files from `scripts/` to a proper `tests/` directory structure
   - Created subdirectories: `wordpress/`, `integration/`, `unit/`
   - Added `__init__.py` files to make them proper Python packages
   - Updated file imports and paths for better compatibility

2. **Created Testing Framework**:
   - Added `conftest.py` with pytest fixtures
   - Created `test_utils.py` with common testing utilities
   - Added sample data in `tests/data/sample_data.json`
   - Fixed test files to work with pytest

3. **Improved Testing Experience**:
   - Added `run_tests.py` and `run_tests.ps1` scripts for easy test execution
   - Created `.env.example` files to guide environment configuration
   - Added a comprehensive README.md in the tests directory

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated `scripts/README.md` to note that tests have been moved
   - Created new documentation on how to run tests
   - Added sample configuration files

5. **Fixed Test Import Issues**:
   - Modified test files to avoid `sys.exit()` when imported by pytest
   - Made environment variable loading more robust
   - Fixed path references

## How to Use the New Structure ðŸš€

1. **Set Up Environment**:
   ```
   # Copy example .env file
   copy config\.env.example config\.env
   # Edit with your credentials
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   ```powershell
   # Windows
   .\run_tests.ps1 wordpress
   .\run_tests.ps1 integration
   .\run_tests.ps1 all
   
   # With Python
   python run_tests.py wordpress
   python run_tests.py integration
   python run_tests.py all
   ```

3. **Add New Tests**:
   - Place WordPress tests in `tests/wordpress/`
   - Place integration tests in `tests/integration/`
   - Place unit tests in `tests/unit/`
   - Use the `test_` prefix for test files and functions

## Next Steps âš¡

1. **Convert Old Tests**: Convert remaining script-style tests to proper pytest tests
2. **Add CI Integration**: Configure GitHub Actions to run tests on push/PR
3. **Improve Test Coverage**: Add more tests for core functionality
4. **Add Documentation Tests**: Test documentation examples and code snippets

The project structure is now much cleaner and follows best practices for Python testing.
