# TEC Testing Framework - Summary of Changes

## üß™ Test Reorganization

### Directory Structure
- Created proper `tests/` directory with subdirectories:
  - `wordpress/` - WordPress integration tests
  - `integration/` - General integration tests
  - `unit/` - Unit tests for core functionality
  - `data/` - Test fixtures and sample data

### Test Framework
- Added proper pytest integration with configurations:
  - `conftest.py` - Pytest fixtures and common setups
  - `pytest.ini` - Global pytest configuration
  - `test_utils.py` - Common test utilities
  - `.env.example` - Example environment variables

### CI/CD Integration
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Created test scripts for CI environments:
  - `run_ci_tests.sh` - For Linux/macOS
  - `run_ci_tests.ps1` - For Windows
- Added code quality tools:
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks for code quality
  - Updated `.gitignore` with test-specific entries

### Usability Improvements
- Created user-friendly test runners:
  - `run_tests.py` - Python script for running tests
  - `run_tests.ps1` - PowerShell script for running tests
- Added comprehensive documentation:
  - `tests/README.md` - Test framework documentation
  - `docs/test_organization.md` - Overall test structure documentation

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Migration**: Move remaining test files from `scripts/` to appropriate test directories
2. **Test Coverage**: Add more tests for core functionality
3. **Documentation**: Document test patterns and best practices
4. **CI Pipeline**: Set up automated test runs on commits/PRs

## üóÉÔ∏è Files Updated

- Modified existing test files:
  - Fixed imports and references
  - Added proper pytest compatibility
  - Removed hardcoded `sys.exit()` calls
  - Added proper error handling

- Created new test framework files:
  - `conftest.py`
  - `test_utils.py`
  - `pytest.ini`
  - `run_tests.py`/`run_tests.ps1`

The test framework is now properly organized and follows best practices for Python testing.
Tests can be run via pytest directly or using the provided runner scripts.
