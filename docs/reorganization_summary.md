# Repository Reorganization Summary

## Changes Made

The following changes have been made to improve the organization of the TEC_CODE repository:

### 1. Instructions Directory

- Created/organized an `/Instructions` directory at the repository root
- Moved instruction files from `.github/instructions/` to this directory
- Created a README.md file explaining the purpose of the instructions
- Confirmed that the name "Budlee the anthrobunny bot" is correct in the TEC_ECHO_ALPHA.instructions.md file

### 2. Legacy Tests Directory

- Created/organized a `Tests` subdirectory within the `scripts` directory
- Moved legacy test scripts to this directory for preservation:
  - enhanced_wordpress_test.py
  - simple_wp_test.py
  - test_roadmap_post.py
  - test_wordpress.py
  - test_wordpress_connection.py
  - test_wordpress_menu.ps1
  - wp_rest_api_test.py
  - wp_test_both_styles.py
- Created a README.md file explaining these are legacy scripts kept for reference

### 3. Documentation Updates

- Updated the main README.md to reflect the new organization
- Updated the scripts/README.md to mention the new Tests directory
- Updated the tests/README.md to mention the legacy scripts
- Updated docs/test_organization.md to include the new organization details
- Created docs/repository_organization.md to document the overall repository structure

## Benefits

This reorganization brings several benefits:

1. **Better Code Organization**: Related files are kept together in logical directories
2. **Clearer Separation of Concerns**: Instructions and test files are clearly distinguished
3. **Preserved Legacy Code**: Old test scripts are preserved but kept separate from active code
4. **Improved Documentation**: Directory purposes are clearly documented
5. **Easier Navigation**: Files are easier to find in their respective directories

## Next Steps

- Continue maintaining this organization pattern for future files
- Consider further organizing other file types (e.g., scripts, configuration files)
- Update any references to the old file locations in documentation or code
