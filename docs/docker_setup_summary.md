2. **Environment Variable Management**
   - Created `.env.template` with placeholder values
   - Updated `env.example` with better documentation
   - Added setup scripts for securely configuring environment variables:
     - `setup_env.ps1` for Windows PowerShell
     - `setup_env.sh` for Linux/macOS

3. **WordPress Integration Testing**
   - Created `test_wordpress.py` to verify WordPress connectivity
   - Fixed environment variable handling in the WordPress agent
   - Enhanced error reporting for WordPress posting issues

4. **Security Improvements**
   - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
   - Added documentation on GitHub security settings
   - Created script for cleaning Git history if secrets are exposed
   - Set up data directory structure with proper Git tracking

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created comprehensive Docker environment setup guide
   - Added script documentation in `scripts/README.md`
   - Updated main README.md with Docker instructions

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Your Environment**
   - Run the setup script to create your `.env` file:
     ```
     cd scripts
     .\setup_env.ps1  # Windows
     ```
   - Enter your WordPress credentials and API keys

2. **Test WordPress Integration**
   - Verify WordPress connectivity:
     ```
     python scripts\test_wordpress.py
     ```

3. **Start Docker Environment**
