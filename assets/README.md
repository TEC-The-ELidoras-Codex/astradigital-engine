# Assets

## Purpose
The `assets` folder contains all multimedia and creative resources used in The Elidoras Codex (TEC) project. This includes audio, video, visuals, and written content.

## Subfolder Structure
- **Audio**: Sound effects, music, and voiceovers.
- **Video**: Animations, trailers, and promotional videos.
- **Visuals**: Graphics, branding materials, and illustrations.
  - **Animations**: Animated assets.
  - **Branding**: Logos, banners, and other branding materials.
  - **Graphics**: Static images and illustrations.
  - **Mindmaps**: Visual mindmaps for planning and brainstorming.
- **Written**: Scripts, storyboards, and other textual content.

## Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names with lowercase letters and hyphens (e.g., `logo-main.png`, `background-music.mp3`).
- Include version numbers if applicable (e.g., `trailer-v1.mp4`).

## Metadata Standards
- Include metadata files (e.g., `metadata.json`) where necessary to describe assets.
- Use consistent tags for categorization (e.g., `type`, `author`, `date`).

## Notes
- Ensure all assets are optimized for their intended use (e.g., compressed images for web, high-quality audio for production).
